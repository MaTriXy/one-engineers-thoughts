Exordium, or introduction
Narration, or background statement of the facts
Partition, or forecast of the topics to be presented
Conformation, or the confirmation of the piece. In contemporary English classes, this would be called the body of the text.
Refutation, or discussion of alternatives
Rhetorical questions, to get the reader thinking.
Peroration, or a conclusion. It’s often helpful to tie the conclusion back to the introduction in order to strengthen your claim..

intro
create setting, normal situation
crisis, problem presented
solution examination
thoughts on alternatives, get reader thinking
conclusion

What is persuasive? This question is at the heart of lawyering and legal
writing.

> One study reports
that judges prefer briefs that are “essays with a clear train of thought”
rather than “repositories of all the information a judge might want to
know.”2
http://www.alwd.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pdf/jalwd-fall-2010-chestek.pdf

That's a clear difference between story and knowledge graph. Clear proof that we don't understand the facts.

> In choosing themes for the two story briefs, I sought to identify deep
frames that would connect with fundamental and nearly universal values
that appellate judges were likely to hold. For the brief on behalf of the
hardware store, therefore, I chose the deep frame of the free market: the
free enterprise system works best when market actors are free to pursue
their economic best interests with the minimum of government inter-ference. For the brief on behalf of the county, the deep frame was
Americana: small towns in America should be free to choose for themselves
what their community looks like and how it functions. (Both
frames, of course, rely on the “uncontested core” that freedom is good.)

> Narrative is the concrete, nonabstract
way that readers experience a set of events13—it is the story form

Narrative is the story of
events, actors, backgrounds, actions, and motives organically related
to express a moral-political significance, a human meaning

> Themes connect facts of the case to the moral lessons of life and
jurors‘ lifetime experiences

A Transformable Language

Humans inherently understand how to transform things. You see ice turn into water. You see a rock crushed into sand. Our mind works the same way. You can see the relations between things. This "transformation" is the theme. Transformation leads to evolution. It provides space for creation.

A Theme is a tool to help readers understand the details.

> meeting with a client or reviewing documents to get facts and then developing those facts into a coherent story.

> Case theory is not
simply a statement of the applicable law or of the facts that support
this legal interpretation, but rather it is the ―basic concept around
which everything else revolves.‖
> The lawyer must constantly be
ready to express things in an original way, to make an imaginatively
organized statement, to speak in a way that meets the occasion and
says what it calls for

story "world". story is linear, world is the end result, the place where everything exists and where you go and remember, it's nonlinear, its the raw facts.

> knowledge is always knowledge
that a person constructs.‖76
 Constructivist
> Constructivists have four general principles.79
 First, learners
construct their own knowledge, meaning that they figure out their
understanding of the material based on their previous experiences.80
 Second,
new learning is not part of an isolated, separate process, but instead, it depends
on what students currently understand
Third, students
need to interact socially during the learning process so that the teacher can
provide feedback to the student; students can then see how their ideas relate to
their peers, and it allows them to continue to relate the new information to their
current understanding.83 Finally, students should learn using problem-based
instruction, with real world tasks, so that they form a new understanding that
will allow them to solve problems they will eventually face.8
