# üìñ Product Development
For each phase of the process, we should iterate on the current phase until everyone involved agrees that all ‚Äúexit criteria‚Äù have been met. After that, the project should move on to the next phase. This prevents backslipping and any associated frustrations.
# Phase 1: Researching
Purpose:
The goal of researching is to bring as much information to light on the problem as possible, without thinking about the solution yet.

Even at the inception of a product idea we have a ton of information at our fingertips. We have past data in SQL and other analytics tools, we have other people‚Äôs perspectives across the company, we have a treasure trove of customer interactions in Zendesk, we have the rest of the internet to search, trends to observe in tools like Builtwith, etc.

Exit criteria:
In order to complete this stage, we want to have a clearly articulated problem we‚Äôre planning to solve and metrics we‚Äôre planning to move.  This research should be written up in a Phase 1 Researching Brief (Template).  A stellar brief dives deep into the problem and supports it with research.  A great brief will:

- clearly articulate the problem(s) we‚Äôre trying to solve
- clearly explain the metric(s) we will use to measure success
- provide a cogent argument that this is a problem worth solving now (be brutal about prioritization ‚Äî there are always many other important things we could be working on!)
# Phase 2: Design & Prototyping
Purpose:
The goal of a design and prototyping sprint is to take all the information in the Phase 1 Brief and combine it with the minds of a few great people with different perspectives (often this will be people from several different guilds). A design sprint consists of a period of ‚Äúdiverging‚Äù thought, where each person separately contributes as many and as wide-ranging ideas as possible. Next, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúconverging‚Äù section where the ideas are organized, discussed, and pared down into a plan of action.

In this stage, we want to finalize a high-level approach to the problem.  When done well, this will often mean build something as cheaply as possible and getting it into the hands of our customers quickly in beta form (note: ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù here can be end users, partners, engineers, another internal team, etc.).

Exit criteria:
We exit the design phase when we all agree on the correct approach to a problem.  A Phase 2 Design & Prototyping Brief (Template) will be written up and appended to the product document. This brief should contain:

- high-level approach to the problem (the edge cases haven‚Äôt necessarily all been figured out yet, but we have done enough diligence that we are confident our approach will work)
- estimate of the total work required to get to beta (as best we understand it)
  - engineer-weeks required, vetted by a tech lead or equivalent
  - designer-weeks required, vetted by a designer
  - other work required, carefully vetted by a PM
- links to design mock-ups explaining the core flows (if applicable)
- links to supporting architecture review docs (if applicable)
# Phase 3: Implementation & Beta
Purpose:
The goal of implementation and beta is to bring the idea into the real world, in the lowest scope and most iterative way possible. The most important ‚Äî and most difficult ‚Äî part of this test is figuring out how to split the implementation into discrete, useful pieces that can be delivered on a rapid (1‚Äì2 week) cadence.

Exit criteria:
We exit this phase when the project has made it to beta phase and has customer feedback from end users. Before we exit this phase, we append a Phase 3 Implementation & Beta Brief (Template), which will outline:

- Summary of the high-level feedback and whether our hypotheses from Phase 1 have been validated
- Compares metrics we‚Äôre seeing in beta to metrics from the Phase 1 Brief
- Thorough consideration of edge cases not yet handled and polish we need
# Phase 4: üö¢-it
Purpose:
Using all of the information from the Phase 3 Brief, we want to take things from early beta to general availability.  Note that for bigger projects, this will often require a lot of work and will likely be one of the longest phases.

This is also a whole-company effort, since it will often require coordination across all parts of engineering/product/design, marketing, sales, customer success, etc. (ie., pretty much everyone!).

Exit criteria:
We exit this phase once we‚Äôve completed our Phase 4 Launch Checklist (Template), which is appended to the product doc (and checkmarked as things are completed!).
# Phase 5: Retrospective
Purpose:
After we complete a project, it‚Äôs important that we take some time to reflect on how the project went, so that we can learn for the future.  No development process is ever perfect, but we can continue to iterate on it if we take the time to reflect once we complete a project.

Exit criteria:
Append a Phase 5 Retrospective (Template) and then publish the finished product doc to all teams who might learn from it!
