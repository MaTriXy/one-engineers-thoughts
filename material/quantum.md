> A huge reduction of
the algorithmʼs complexity is achieved by requiring linearity,
unitarity, locality, homogeneity, and isotropy of
the interactions. http://www.qubit.it/research/publications/scripta_dirac.pdf

```
axiom linearity
axiom unitarity
axiom locality
axiom homogeneity
axiom isotropy
```

>  This reduces the the physical law to a quantum cellular automaton (QCA).
>  Starting from the Weyl automaton pair as the building block, one can build other QCA pairs by direct sum and tensor products. In this way, one achieves automata that give the Diracʼs and the Maxwell field equations in the relativistic limit.

> Most relevantly, the
theory is quantum ab initio, with no need of quantization
rules. This is the bonus of regarding information as more
fundamental than matter.
