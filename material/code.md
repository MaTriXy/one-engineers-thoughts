Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

> Miscellaneous notes:

Only a species or an infraspecific taxon can have a type of its own. For most new taxa (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.
A genus has the same type as that of one of its species (article 10).
A family has the same type as that of one of its genera (article 10).
