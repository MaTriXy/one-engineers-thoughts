First phase is "product/market fit". Once you get that, the next phase is "product/vision fit". That is, you first try to make sure people use it, so you solve their base problems, so the product can be sustained/funded. Then once you have sustainable funding, then you expand your product to fit your larger vision.

So first, secure sustainable funding by solving customer problems (product/market fit), then start changing the world (product/vision fit).

Find area of focus (problems you solve for customers, specific customers/audience).

Marketing needs to be _clear_ and _simple_. Clear and simple, two words an ideal product would be.

Don't implement a feature or work on a specific aspect of the product unless it solves one of your goals (bringing more customers in, or scaling).
