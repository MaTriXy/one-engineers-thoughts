> Cycle sort is an in-place, unstable sorting algorithm, a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array, unlike any other in-place sorting algorithm. It is based on the idea that the permutation to be sorted can be factored into cycles, which can individually be rotated to give a sorted result.

```
sort fast, if know which elements appear in array
  just count number of each type
  spit into array that number of times

quick sort can be done in place
```
