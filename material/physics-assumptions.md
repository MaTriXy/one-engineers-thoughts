- In the 11th century, the Chinese scientist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was the first person to write of the magnetic needle compass and that it improved the accuracy of navigation by employing the astronomical concept of true north (Dream Pool Essays, AD 1088 ), and by the 12th century the Chinese were known to use the lodestone compass for navigation. In 1187, Alexander Neckam was the first in Europe to describe the compass and its use for navigation.
- Greek scholar and writer of the 12th century, records that Woliver, king of the Goths, was able to draw sparks from his body. The same writer states that a certain philosopher was able while dressing to draw sparks from his clothes, a result seemingly akin to that obtained by Robert Symmer in his silk stocking experiments
- Lightning creates fire.
- 1500's Gilbert undertook a number of careful electrical experiments, in the course of which he discovered that many substances other than amber, such as sulphur, wax, glass, etc.,[24] were capable of manifesting electrical properties. Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impaired the insulation of such bodies. He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron. The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of founder of the electrical science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert_(astronomer)

- The ladder is an example of something that solves 90% of our use cases, until you want to carry very heavy things to very high places. Then you need a crane. And the general pattern is a scalable heavy object lifter, rather than a ladder, sorta thing. Shows how you can form a theory (working with objects in high places), and it can be satisfactory for 90% of cases. But needs to be rethought once you have a new use case.

### Quantum Observations

- non observation Have never observed planck length

  + assumption Due to weak interaction
  + Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay

    - person Henri Becquerel
    - while Working with phosphorescent materials.
  - Rutherford started to explore its radioactivity, discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms alpha ray and beta ray in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of radiation.
- experiment Gold foil experiment
  + person Rutherford
- Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968.[6][7] Accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The top quark was the last to be discovered at Fermilab in 1995. http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/9503002v2.pdf
- Louis Pasteur separates a racemic mixture of two enantiomers by sorting individual crystals, and demonstrates their impact on the polarization of light (1849).
- Svante Arrhenius studies the conductivity of salt solutions and determines that salts dissociate into ions in water (1884).
Svante Arrhenius determines the impact of temperature on reaction rates and formulates the concept of activation energy (1889).
- Anders Jonas Ångström observes the presence of hydrogen and other elements in the spectrum of the sun (1862).
- François-Marie Raoult demonstrates that the decrease in the vapor pressure and freezing point of liquids caused by the addition of solutes is proportional to the number of solute molecules present. This establishes the concept of colligative properties (1878).

  + assumes particle model (how does it know it extracted particles?)
  + assumes magnetic field model
- casimir effect: It was not until 1997, however, that a direct experiment, by S. Lamoreaux, described above, quantitatively measured the force (to within 15% of the value predicted by the theory),[6] although previous work [e.g. van Blockland and Overbeek (1978)] had observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy had been made by measuring the thickness of liquid helium films by Sabisky and Anderson in 1972. Subsequent experiments approach an accuracy of a few percent.
? Experiments at CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) first tried to create the QGP in the 1980s and 1990s: the results led CERN to announce indirect evidence for a "new state of matter"[3] in 2000. Current experiments (2011) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) on Long Island (NY, USA) and at CERN's recent Large Hadron Collider near Geneva (Switzerland) are continuing this effort,[4][5] by colliding relativistically accelerated gold (at RHIC) or lead (at LHC) with each other or with protons. Although the results have yet to be independently verified as of February 2010, scientists at Brookhaven RHIC have tentatively claimed to have created a quark–gluon plasma with an approximate temperature of 4 trillion (4×1012) degrees Kelvin. http://www0.bnl.gov/rhic/news2/news.asp?a=1074&t=pr
- Although the experimental high temperatures and densities predicted as producing a quark–gluon plasma have been realized in the laboratory, the resulting matter does not behave as a quasi-ideal state of free quarks and gluons, but, rather, as an almost perfect dense fluid.[10] Actually, the fact that the quark–gluon plasma will not yet be "free" at temperatures realized at present accelerators was predicted in 1984 as a consequence of the remnant effects of confinement.[11][12]

- Both terrestrial and astronomical experiments have been carried out, and new experimental techniques have been introduced.

### Quantum Hypotheses

- A quark–gluon plasma (QGP) or quark soup[1] is a state of matter in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) which is hypothesized to exist at extremely high temperature, density, or both temperature and density
- Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that cannot be seen with telescopes but would account for most of the matter in the universe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter . The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.
- Predicted in 1916[1][2] by Albert Einstein to exist on the basis of his theory of general relativity,[3][4] gravitational waves theoretically transport energy as gravitational radiation. Various gravitational wave detectors exist and on 17 March 2014, astronomers at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics claimed that they had detected and produced "the first direct image of gravitational waves across the primordial sky" within the cosmic microwave background, providing strong evidence for inflation and the Big Bang.
- Entropic gravity, as proposed by Verlinde in his original article, reproduces Einstein field equations and, in a Newtonian approximation, a 1/r potential for gravitational forces.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_aether_theory
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_searches_for_Lorentz_violation
- in Lorentz aether theory the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the relativity principle holds. The theory was quickly replaced by special relativity, which gave similar formulas without the existence of an unobservable aether

  + assumption Doppler effect of light.
  + opposite evidence There is evidence that some stars have different colors, but not corresponding to doppler effect.
- COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) provided the first detection of the intrinsic fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1990s. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_formation
- Another important property of the primordial perturbations, that they are adiabatic (or isentropic between the various kinds of matter that compose the Universe), is predicted by cosmic inflation and has been confirmed by observations.
- superclusters? Research has been done to try and understand the way in which superclusters are arranged in space. Maps are used to display the positions of 1.6 million galaxies.Three-dimensional maps are used to further understand the positions of these superclusters. In order to map them three-dimensionally, the position of the galaxy in the sky as well as the galaxy's redshift are used for calculation. The galaxy's redshift is used with the Hubble Law in order to determine its position in three-dimensional space.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Ultra-Deep_Field
- In 1998 two independent projects, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the High-Z Supernova Search Team simultaneously obtained results suggesting a totally unexpected acceleration in the expansion of the universe by using distant type Ia supernovae as standard candles.[3][4][5] Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded Nobel Prizes for their discovery.[6] Confirmatory evidence has been found in baryon acoustic oscillations and other new results about the clustering of galaxies.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova
- Both John Russell Hind in 1848 and Norman Pogson in 1863 had charted stars that underwent sudden changes in brightness. However these received little attention from the astronomical community. Finally, in 1866, English astronomer William Huggins made the first spectroscopic observations of a nova, discovering lines of hydrogen in the unusual spectrum of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis.[19] Huggins proposed a cataclysmic explosion as the underlying mechanism, and his efforts drew interest from other astronomers.
- In 1885, a nova-like outburst was observed in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.
- Although supernovae are relatively rare events, occurring on average about once every 50 years in the Milky Way,[25] observations of distant galaxies allowed supernovae to be discovered and examined more frequently. The first supernova detection patrol was begun by Zwicky in 1933. He was joined by Josef J. Johnson from Caltech in 1936. Using a 45-cm Schmidt telescope at Palomar observatory, they discovered twelve new supernovae within three years by comparing new photographic plates to reference images of extragalactic regions.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_2003fg
- On May 21, 2008, astronomers announced that they had for the first time caught a supernova on camera just as it was exploding. By chance, a burst of X-rays was noticed while looking at galaxy NGC 2770, 88 million light-years from Earth, and a variety of telescopes were aimed in that direction just in time to capture what has been named SN 2008D. "This eventually confirmed that the big X-ray blast marked the birth of a supernova," said Alicia Soderberg of Princeton University.[55]
- In 2009, researchers have found nitrates in ice cores from Antarctica at depths corresponding to the known supernovae of 1006 and 1054 AD, as well as from around 1060 AD. The nitrates were apparently formed from nitrogen oxides created by gamma rays from the supernovae. This technique should be able to detect supernovae going back several thousand years.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud
- On February 21, 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life.

#### Cosmology Conclusions

- The existence of superclusters indicates that the galaxies in our Universe are not uniformly distributed.

#### Cosmology techniques

  + The parameters that appear in Hubble’s law: velocities and distances, are not directly measured. In reality we determine, say, a supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the redshift z = ∆λ/λ of its spectrum of radiation. Hubble correlated brightness and parameter z.

These objects of known brightness are termed standard candles.

### Electromagnetism Observations

How to write observations formally? What is their type structure?

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron
- In the early 1700s, Francis Hauksbee and French chemist Charles François de Fay independently discovered what they believed were two kinds of frictional electricity—one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin. From this, Du Fay theorized that electricity consists of two electrical fluids, vitreous and resinous, that are separated by friction, and that neutralize each other when combined.[16] A decade later Benjamin Franklin proposed that electricity was not from different types of electrical fluid, but the same electrical fluid under different pressures. He gave them the modern charge nomenclature of positive and negative respectively. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_experiment http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/47/565.full.pdf
- In 1750, he published a proposal for an experiment to prove that lightning is electricity by flying a kite in a storm that appeared capable of becoming a lightning storm. On May 10, 1752, Thomas-François Dalibard of France conducted Franklin's experiment using a 40-foot-tall (12 m) iron rod instead of a kite, and he extracted electrical sparks from a cloud. 
- photoelectric effect In 1887, Heinrich Hertz[2][3] discovered that electrodes illuminated with ultraviolet light create electric sparks more easily. In 1905 Albert Einstein published a paper that explained experimental data from the photoelectric effect as being the result of light energy being carried in discrete quantized packets https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect
- In 1845, Faraday discovered that many materials exhibit a weak repulsion from a magnetic field: a phenomenon he termed diamagnetism.[45]
- observation Polarization of light Faraday also discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light can be rotated by the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the direction in which the light is moving.
- electric currents create magnetic fields
- 1672 – Isaac Newton publishes the results of his Prism experiments, demonstrating the existence in white light of a mixture of distinct coloured rays.
- Diffraction of light
  + assumption Light is a wave and a particle.

    * use television
    * use wireless communication
- Polarization of light
  + explained By light as a wave
- plane of polarisation of linearly polarised light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric, an effect now known as Faraday rotation
  + evidence Light is related to magnetism
- black-body radiation A perfectly insulated enclosure that is in thermal equilibrium internally contains black-body radiation and will emit it through a hole made in its wall, provided the hole is small enough to have negligible effect upon the equilibrium.
- Spectrum of light
- Superconductivity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity
- Henry Cavendish independently conceived a theory of electricity nearly akin to that of Aepinus.[48] In 1784, he was perhaps the first to utilize an electric spark to produce an explosion of hydrogen and oxygen in the proper proportions that would create pure water. Cavendish also discovered the inductive capacity of dielectrics (insulators), and, as early as 1778, measured the specific inductive capacity for beeswax and other substances by comparison with an air condenser.
- Around 1784 C. A. Coulomb devised the torsion balance, discovering what is now known as Coulomb's law: the force exerted between two small electrified bodies varies inversely as the square of the distance, not as Aepinus in his theory of electricity had assumed, merely inversely as the distance.
- In 1800, William Nicholson and Johann Wilhelm Ritter succeeded in decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis
- Davy in 1806, employing a voltaic pile of approximately 250 cells, or couples, decomposed potash and soda, showing that these substances were respectively the oxides of potassium and sodium, which metals previously had been unknown.
- In 1821, Estonian-German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck demonstrated the electrical potential in the juncture points of two dissimilar metals when there is a heat difference between the joints.
- William Grove produced the first fuel cell in 1839.
- The German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hittorf studied electrical conductivity in rarefied gases: in 1869, he discovered a glow emitted from the cathode that increased in size with decrease in gas pressure.
- In 1876, the German physicist Eugen Goldstein showed that the rays from this glow cast a shadow, and he dubbed the rays cathode rays.
- During the 1870s, the English chemist and physicist Sir William Crookes developed the first cathode ray tube to have a high vacuum inside.[27] He then showed that the luminescence rays appearing within the tube carried energy and moved from the cathode to the anode. Furthermore, by applying a magnetic field, he was able to deflect the rays, thereby demonstrating that the beam behaved as though it were negatively charged.
- In 1886, Paul Héroult and Charles M. Hall developed an efficient method (the Hall–Héroult process) to obtain aluminium using electrolysis of molten alumina.
- 1909 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment determine charge of electron
- 1745: Ewald Georg von Kleist of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a dielectric) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. Daniel Gralath improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
- 1791: Luigi Galvani discovers galvanic electricity and bioelectricity through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the galvanic battery.[6]

## My thoughts

Entropy is an assumption, derived out of an observation of change. Maybe it should be about change rather than entropy.

## Notes

> proving time irreversibility in a mathematical sense is (as of 2006) impossible https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(arrow_of_time)

## Unsolved problems

- As of 2006, this type of time-symmetry breaking has been demonstrated for only a very small number of exactly-solvable, discrete-time systems. The transfer operator for more complex systems has not been consistently formulated, and its precise definition is mired in a variety of subtle difficulties. In particular, it has not been shown that it has a broken symmetry for the simplest exactly-solvable continuous-time ergodic systems, such as Hadamard's billiards, or the Anosov flow on the tangent space of PSL(2,R).

  + Faraday rotation
    * Faraday, having discussed the problem with the two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet;
  - Faraday's breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an iron ring, and found that upon passing a current through one coil a momentary current was induced in the other coil.[2] This phenomenon is now known as mutual induction.

- In 1821, Danish physicist and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism
  + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted
  + > On 21 April 1820, during a lecture, Ørsted noticed a compass needle deflected from magnetic north when an electric current from a battery was switched on and off, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism.[5] His initial interpretation was that magnetic effects radiate from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current, as do light and heat. Three months later he began more intensive investigations and soon thereafter published his findings, showing that an electric current produces a circular magnetic field as it flows through a wire. This discovery was not due to mere chance, since Ørsted had been looking for a relation between electricity and magnetism for several years. The special symmetry of the phenomenon was possibly one of the difficulties that retarded the discovery

I think I disagree with this guy - http://motls.blogspot.ru/2010/01/erik-verlinde-why-gravity-cant-be.html. Let's see in a few years! (wrote july 4, 2015)

> Displaced aether pushing back and exerting inward pressure toward matter is gravity.

> The ideas of 'tHooft are to reproduce quantum mechanics from a stochastic theory which is massively nonlocal

> Dirac thought determinism would be restored.

> It is pointed out that a mathematical relation exists between cellular automata and quantum field theories. quantum mechanics may be nothing but a natural way to handle the statistical correlations of a cellular automaton.

> Whatever the real objects are, quantum mechanics emerges as an extremely effective mathematical machinery to describe their statistical features in terms of probability distributions.
