fact
  For example, animals very similar to Ratufa and possibly belonging to this genus–at least belonging to the Ratufinae–were part of the early Langhian (Middle Miocene, some 16–15.2 million years ago) Hambach fauna of Germany.[1]

Rename all the things, isometric and photon and everything. Use basic words only.

You can't isolate a single molecule. It has to be touching something. It has to be physically part of something. So in a sense, these are really blocks that are locked into position until they are matched.

> Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) is a highly pure and ordered form of synthetic graphite. It is characterised by a low mosaic spread angle, meaning that the individual graphite crystallites are well aligned with each other. The best HOPG samples have mosaic spreads of less than 1 degree. It is used in and x-ray optics as a monochromator and in scanning probe microscopy as a substrate and for magnification calibration.


The scientists are just continuing to use the language that nobody understands, trying to get us to understand through education. But what we really should be doing is just updating the knowledge. Make the user experience better. Make it easier to understand.
