Modal Transition Systems are extensions of labelled transition systems.

> Modal mu-calculus provides one of the strongest examples of the connections between modal and temporal logics, automata theory and the theory of games.

> Propositional Dynamic Logic, PDL, refers to this logic. PDL is interpreted with respect to a model on a Kripke structure, formalizing the notion of the global state in which programs execute and which they change—each point in the structure corresponds to a possible state, and programs determine a relation between states giving the changes effected by the programs.

"accessibility relation", states accessible from other states.

> Hennessy–Milner logic (HML) was introduced as an alternative exposition of observational equivalence.

> Later it was realised that modal logics are merely sublogics of appropriate monadic second-order logic, and that the automata normal forms provide a very powerful framework within which to study properties of modal logic. A further development was the use of games by Gurevich and Harrington [30] as an alternative to automata.

> The most important application area for the modal µ-calculus is the formal
specification and verification of computer systems.

> modal input/output automata (MIOs) explicitly support loose specifications and offer an elegant approach to stepwise refinement.

> Interface theories are employed in the component-based design of concurrent systems. They often emerge as combinations of Interface Automata (IA) and Modal Transition Systems (MTS). http://www.swt-bamberg.de/luettgen/publications/pdf/Augsburg-TR-2014-06.pdf

> To achieve the abstraction of software, a device that physically embodies a model of execution is required. https://www.asc.edu/seminars/mitrionics_asc_2007-02-23.pdf
