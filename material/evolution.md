Predator brains represent other life forms as resources. They don't recognize them as intelligent agents with their own internal experiences. So this is why predation occurs below level of conscious intelligence, and even at early stages of conscious intelligence. But it is not required. As long as there is sufficient plant material, and no genetic adaptation to consumption of animal material, that it will stay non-carnivore.
