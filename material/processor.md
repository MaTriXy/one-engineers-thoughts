> A “Processor” is a physical machine:
hardware that performs your program,
written in software
https://www.asc.edu/seminars/mitrionics_asc_2007-02-23.pdf

Completely separates hardware from
software
– ISA: branches, arithmetic operations,
indirect indexing, status registers,
etc, etc
– Circuits: gates, flip-flops, clocks,
PLLs, latches, etc, etc

> Soft cores are processor implementations in an HDL language without extensive optimization for the target architecture. Soft cores typically have lower performance and are less efficient in terms of resource utilization. Firm cores are also HDL implementations but have been optimized for a target FPGA architecture.
