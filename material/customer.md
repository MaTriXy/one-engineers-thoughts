definition customer
  An intelligent agent that uses your product
```

"Using" means applying product to solve a problem they experience. Products are tools used for creating experiences.

Definition tree:

```
A _customer_ is an intelligent agent that *uses* your *product*.
A _customer_ is an intelligent agent that *applies* your *solution* to a *problem* they *experience*.
A _customer_ is an intelligent agent that *acts* in a _state_ to _change_ it to a *desired* state.
```

Once we get down to state change, sorta-thing, you are done, you have defined your term without any ambiguities. 

```
definition customer
  A [customer] is an [intelligent] [agent] that [uses] your [product]
  A [customer] is a [problem] [solving] structure agent that [acts] to change the state to their [desired] state.
  A [customer] is a structure that changes the current state to [desired] states, that uses your state changer to change their current state to [desired] states.
```

Problem with that is it's kinda hard to see where variables start.
