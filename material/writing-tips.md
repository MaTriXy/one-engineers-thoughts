The best time to write is right when you're learning, because you are in the same frame of mind as the learner.

This is the reason why university-style teaching is the wrong approach.

definition matter
  example Write about what matters

write
  when learned something new
  when creating order out of chaos
  when you just finish a project
  when you have an idea that keeps going through your mind
  when people keep asking you to help with something

then
  pick your audience
    how much time do you spend thinking about your audience
    how much knowledge do you expect people to have
    audiences have different vocabulary
      beginners have one vocabulary
      experts have another vocabulary
  intro
    quickly tell readers what they can expect from the post
      thesis
    if just facts
      outline why you are presenting the facts
      why are they interesting to you
      what trend you find
  body
    make sure every part ties back to the thesis
    chose logical order for arguments
      temporal
      strength 2, 1, 3
    point to other research to make your claim stronger
  conclusion
    don't just summarize, make a new point, to broaden the argument to make it bigger
    discuss nuances and caveats
    leave reader with something to think about

best blog posts
  opinionated
  specific
    want to go away from blog post thinking "i can implement this right now"
  helpful
    make sure people can apply to own situation

paragraphs
  vary from 1-4 sentences
sentences
  keep short, 1 idea each. this comes in the editing phase
words
  don't get fancy

read it out loud

process
  step
    either
      go start with prototype
      or start with an email, like you are writing to someone
      or start with a conversation
  step
    write an outline
      list of points you want to make in an article
        how do you figure out which points you want to write
  step 3 hours
    write basic
  step
    write a list of potential titles
  step
    let it sit for a day
  step 1 hour
    edit it
  step
    send to a friend for 20% feedback
  step 1-2 hours
    refine ideas to 80%
  step
    finish it

how to break it down
  discrete topic that they could fully understand in one sitting
    single article should be 5-10 minute reading
  something that doesn't seem overwhelming to read

to pick your audience
  create similar audience
