> Modal auxiliary verbs, such as the English words may, can, must, ought, will, shall, need, dare, might, could, would, and should, are often used to express modality, especially in the Germanic languages.

>  modality â€“ that is, likelihood, ability, permission, and obligation.
> Examples include the English verbs can/could, may/might, must, will/would, and shall/should. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_modality

> In standard formal approaches to modality, an utterance expressing modality can always roughly be paraphrased to fit the following template:
> (1) According to [a set of rules, wishes, beliefs,...] it is [necessary, possible] that [the main proposition] is the case.

Statement about desirability of future state "being good". But you might not have any conscious reasons why they are good. Still, you should be able to write them down without any reasons, so you don't forget. And so you can learn to get better at knowing what is good and bad.

Therefore, steps:

1. write `would be good, ...`
2. later, write `reason why`
3. use reasons why to learn how to identify other desired properties of the end state
4. use those to create problem definitions
5. prioritize problems to solve
6. solve problems
7. implement solution
8. repeat

> Epistemic modality is a sub-type of linguistic modality that deals with a speaker's evaluation/judgment of, degree of confidence in, or belief of the knowledge upon which a proposition is based

So modal logic is used by intelligent agents to express their feelings about facts.

> I doubt that it rained yesterday. (judgement epistemic: judgement of information source)
> I heard that it rained yesterday. (evidential: identification of information source)

> Examples of the expression of epistemic modality in English are: he might be there (low probability, substantial doubt), He may be there (possibility), He should be there by now (high probability), and He must be there by now (certitude, no doubt).

> freedom to act (including ability, permission, and duty)
> English examples include She can go (ability), You may go (permission), You should go (request), and You must go (command).
> He must be there by now (epistemic) versus He must be there tomorrow at noon (deontic).

> reel presupposes visual and kinesthetic map
> backwards, same
> tripping, same
> screaming, auditory map
> pain, kinesthetic map
> bitter, gustatory, olfactory maps

> Language representation systems are reflexive, meta representational systems.

Therefore, visual words, auditory words, gustatory words, oflaction words, kinesthetic words
