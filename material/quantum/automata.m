wavenumber
  is frequency(spatial), of wave
    number of waves over a specified distance
  when multiplied by plancks constant
    is momentum, of wave

> Within this perspective space and time are not on an equal footing, the space emerges
from the structure of the graph while the time variable comes from the computational
steps of the automaton

> Moreover the QCA is the ideal framework
for a quantum theory of gravity, being the automaton
theory quantum ab initio

> The Dirac equation emerges
from the large-scale dynamics of the minimum-dimension
QCA satisfying unitarity, locality, homogeneity, and discrete
isotropy of interactions.

> The most prominent example of a fermionic field is the Dirac field, which describes fermions with spin-1/2: electrons, protons, quarks, etc. The Dirac field can be described as either a 4-component spinor or as a pair of 2-component Weyl spinors.

> Instead of associating to each site an Hilbert space, we associate to them the observable
algebra Ax, denoted the cell structure.

Physics as information processing.

> The QCA thus provides an extended quantum field theory
that unifies the Planck scale with the Fermi scale. Starting
from the Weyl automaton pair as the building block, one can
build other QCA pairs by direct sum and tensor products. In
this way, one achieves automata that give the DiracÊ¼s and the
Maxwell field equations in the relativistic limit. The free
electromagnetic field is recovered in the form of the neutrino
theory of light [19] of De Broglie [20], considered also by
Jordan [21], Born and Nagendra Nath [22, 23], and Kronig
[24], and rediscovered in more recent times by Perkins [25].
With the principle of bounded information density, bosonic
fields also become an emergent notion, and they are ultimately
based on Fermionic systems evolved by the
automaton.

> The discreteness of the lattice avoids all problems that
plague quantum field theory arising from the continuum,
especially the problem of localization. Most relevantly, the
theory is quantum ab initio, with no need of quantization
rules. This is the bonus of regarding information as more
fundamental than matter.
