> The PSPACE-complete problems are widely suspected to be outside the more famous complexity classes P and NP, but that is not known.

> a complexity class is a set of problems of related resource-based complexity

> It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by Savitch's theorem.

> Other important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using boolean circuits and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines. #P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems. ALL is the class of all decision problems.

> A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X

> A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C.

Complexity revolves around _turing machines_, but these are not the only form of machines. We also have associative machines, and others. Turing machines require RAM (random access memory), but content addressible memory is a whole different thing.
