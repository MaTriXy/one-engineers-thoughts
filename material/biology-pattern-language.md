> We show that DPMs, acting individually and in concert with each other,
constitute a ‘pattern language’ capable of generating all metazoan body plans and organ forms

> The body plans of essentially all the modern types of animals—
sponges, molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, chordates, and so
on, emerged within a period of 20 million years or less (Rokas
et al 2005) about 550–530 million years ago (Conway 2006).

> By dynamical patterning modules (abbreviated DPM) we
mean a set of molecules produced in a cluster of cells, along
with one or more physical effects mobilized by these molecules
so as to generate an aspect or alteration in the cluster’s form or
pattern. Roughly speaking, ‘form’ comprises shape, size and
topology, and ‘pattern’ comprises specific arrangement of cell
types.

> Depending on laboratory culture conditions,
choanoflagellates are unicellular, or form small colonies.

> Cell adhesion, which in modern metazoa is mediated by several
different classes of integral membrane proteins, is a necessary
and sufficient condition for establishment of at least a primitive
form of multicellularity

> Eventually, by random cell movement, the islands coalesce
and an interface is established across which cells will not
intermix (Steinberg 1998). The physical basis of this sorting
out of cell populations is equivalent to phase separation of
two immiscible liquids, such as oil and water (Forgacs and
Newman 2005)

> Andrew Parker has proposed that predator-prey relationships changed dramatically after eyesight evolved. Prior to that time, hunting and evading were both close-range affairs – smell, vibration, and touch were the only senses used.

extinction == loss
evolution to new species == gain

same gain, evolution to new species
same loss, extinction

> There were two similar explosions in the evolution of land plants: after a cryptic history beginning about 450 million years ago, land plants underwent a uniquely rapid adaptive radiation during the Devonian period, about 400 million years ago.[23] Furthermore, Angiosperms (flowering plants) originated and rapidly diversified during the Cretaceous period.

> It took almost 4 billion years from the formation of the Earth for the Ediacaran fossils to first appear, 655 million years ago.
