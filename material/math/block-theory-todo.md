  study eigenspinor, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenspinor
    definition In quantum mechanics, eigenspinors are thought of as basis vectors representing the general spin state of a particle
    note Like geometric vectors and more general tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a slight (infinitesimal) rotation. When a sequence of such small rotations is composed (integrated) to form an overall final rotation, however, the resulting spinor transformation depends on which sequence of small rotations was used, unlike for vectors and tensors. A spinor transforms to its negative when the space is rotated through a complete turn from 0° to 360° (see picture), and it is this property that characterizes spinors.

The square root is just the length of the side of square, where the value inside the radical is the value of the area of the square. So it doesn't make sense to have non discrete squares. Its sides can either be 1, 2, 3, ... n, which all have square roots by definition.

Tissue pattern formation is a parallel of when individuals come together into large groups, but before they come together to make a larger individual structure like the organism.

So:

1. individuals / integration
2. individuals in society
3. interacting and differentiating societies
4. new individuals from coordinated, differentiating, interacting societies

Or:

1. origin of cells
2. cell groups/patterns
3. tissues
4. organisms (plants and animals)

Or:

1. origin of atoms/molecules from particles
2. molecular groups/patterns (crystals, soups)
3. metabolism
4. cells

Or:

1. origin of information / facts / records
2. groups of facts, patterns of facts
3. interacting patterns (encoding/decoding of the underlying individual facts)
4. particles

So we're in the middle state:

1. origin of humans/animals/organisms
2. families/societies
3. nations
4. planetary intelligence?

Maybe planetary intelligence is where space exploration will uncover several new intelligent planets. Then we are at the level of the individual again. Each planet has to decide how it can act in relation to the other. The parts (humans and earth systems) have to limit their activity to the survival of the whole planetary intelligence. This is likely to be governed automatically by a new kind of "artificial intelligence".

We can also say that, it must take lots of time to experiment with lots of different patterns in a certain layer of abstraction. Animal evolution has been occurring for over 500 million years. Cell evolution for over 4 billion, atom evolution for over 5 billion years.

But the part that takes a long time is, the coming together of the individuals into society, and getting those societies to work together to create the next level of abstraction.

So in the end it seems to be a cycle of interaction and integration.

- interaction
- integration

Parallel processes.

Or:

- integration
- differentiation

Since processes -- like the interaction of societies to form an integrated whole -- are at each of these stages, then the process algebra can be used. In a sense, they are all reactive systems, and so can be formally verified using temporal logics.

So this means we can have a better definition of "scale" that is relative, instead of being arbitrary like the metric system. The difference in scale is completely governed by the whole/part relationship.

At all of these levels, there is intelligence. Information memories are formed, which then start sending signals to each other. Then a statistical pattern recognizer compresses the information, just like a brain. And then it learns the language of the subsystem, and uses it to make decisions. It uses the language of the subsystem as knowledge essentially.

An evolving network or thread of interaction and integration.

The experience of the upper is a summary or abstraction of the lower. So experience occurs at the level of the interpretation of the lower signals from the individuals perspective.
