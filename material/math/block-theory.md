# Block Theory

Like category theory but a lot simpler for the human brain to visualize.

Can create a book, like "Blocks", like the elements. But all of math.

THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO BE LIKE: http://www.touchpress.com/

```coffee
use opposite(type), not inverse
use opposite(direction), not reverse

  Angle comes from the word for corner, or fish hook.

use side
use line
use width
use size, not magnitude (how big)
use tall, not height?
use short, not finite
use super(long), not infinite

use part
use space, for area, width, height, volume, distance

## Block

Everything can be built from blocks. There are:

- patterns of blocks is the most general
- groups of blocks, which are specific patterns we are focusing on
- lines of blocks
- grids of blocks
- trees of blocks
- mazes of blocks
- waves of blocks
- piles of blocks Bags of blocks Blocks in their unorganized state. Maybe "pools" of blocks, or "boxes" of blocks. or "heap" or "pile" of blocks.
- boards of blocks, or sheets of blocks
- collection of blocks: All of the blocks you have in an organized state. Maybe these are the boxes of blocks, like the records. Or a group of blocks, groups of blocks, where the groups have certain properties.

All blocks can have data. This data can be arbitrary values, or it can be pointers or references to other blocks. You can imagine it from a blocks perspective: if a block is pointing to another block, really the block is looking or focusing on another block. It has in it's memory a symbol standing for another block, the "address" or location, or "place" of the block.

Functions and matrices can all be visualized as blocks. All continuous functions can be represented as blocks too, since we assume the universe is inherently discrete.

Curves and such are really blocks where we can't see the individual blocks; they are too small from our _perspective_, or point of view.

The blocks are items of the set of all the blocks you currently see.

A line has an order. A pile doesn't have an order.

Blocks have no order by themselves, they are only ordered based on what data they have inside them. The blocks themselves you should think of as having no position. The blocks, then, are like the data structures.

Define patterns for types. Then all types/patterns can be converted to blocks, so you can explore their properties. Then algorithms/actions in a reactive system, would just be animated blocks / moving blocks. Or still snapshots like a comic book.

Then we first have to describe how space can emerge using quantum mechanics information theory. This gives us space, and then matter. Then with light interacting with matter, we get light waves, and so we can get color. So we need to allocate a certain part of the matter in the universe that can respond to color, the things in your screen, and draw pixels with color.

Math and physics is essentially our creation story based on our observations of the universe. So it should be possible to generate all of math from a single object. This single object, is either something, or nothing, or neither something nor nothing. But we can model it as something, a block.
