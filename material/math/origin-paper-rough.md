## Introduction

Objects interacting with other objects is so common, we hardly notice it. In our everyday life, it's our social interactions[cite]. In biology, it's species interactions[cite]. In chemistry, molecular interactions[cite]. And in math, it's structure interaction.

Information is structure. Structure in action. Structure we also call pattern.

Information interactions at first appears simple [example]. But it is difficult to formalize.

```
pattern information
```

## Verification

Individuals can communicate and perform actions as part of a reactive system. Reactive systems can be formally verified using temporal logic. This means the interaction of individuals can be formally modeled on a computer. This means that all particles, atoms, molecules, cells, organisms, and societies can be formally modeled on a computer.

## Individuals

Individuals have rules for governing themselves, and collective rules for governing interaction between individuals. Individuals quickly become part of a larger, unintegrated whole, after the individual emerges from a previously integrated whole. This happens after the second individual is now a part of the group.

```
pattern individual
```

When a new layer for individuals emerges, there is an individual _explosion_:

- particles
- molecules
- cells
- organisms


```
process explosion
```

Then there is a very long period of _diversification_. This is where many different patterns are generated, each with their own unique set of rules.

```
process diversification
```

## Interaction

```
process interaction
process communication
process collaboration
process civilization
process globalization
```

Then there is _communication_.

Then there is _collaboration_, and societies form.

Then there is _civilization_, integrated societies. And these civilizations each have different codes, and so have difficulty determining which actions to take. Sometimes leads to peace. Other times, conflict.

Then there is _globalization_, where all civilizations of this layer of individuals interact as a unified whole. This makes room for a new layer of individuals to form.

communication -> collaboration -> civilization -> globalization is really just a gradual increase in complexity of the interaction of the individuals.

```
process interaction
  option process communication
  option process collaboration
  option process civilization
  option process globalization
  option process standardization
```

## Lifetime

Individuals have a lifetime. This means they are born and they pass away. During the time of an individual, it can experience all kinds of problems and solutions. A story makes another individual experience the life of the author.

```
process experience
```

This is also why individual particles last longer than individual molecules, and why molecules last longer than cells. Cells invented a way to regenerate while the parent is in motion, which is pretty cool.

```
pattern life, of individual
  pattern start
  pattern end
  pattern experience, process experience
```

## Collection

Some individuals function as the memory. Others function as internal messaging. This forms a new layer of individual.

```
pattern collection
```

But this new layer may not have its own memory yet. It's parts may have an internal memory, but this new whole may not have a memory. This is why slime molds can be said to have a memory but not a brain. They are the whole multicellular organisms that were just beginning to develop the machinery for memory. Once they developed memory, then they can develop communication.

In the same way, cells also developed memory, and communication. Maybe, too, atoms developed memory (matter), and communication (light).

The question is, what was the development process of the original individual. How can pure information start as an individual and evolve to a functioning individual within a society, and eventually result in the emergence of a new individual layer. This is the central problem this thesis will address.

```
process evolution
```

The developments of the whole are the major features we see in a layer of individuals:

```
evolution animal
  feature tissue
  feature brain
  feature emotion
  feature thought

evolution plant

evolution molecule
  feature protein
  feature atom
  feature compound

evolution particle
  feature energy
  feature mass
  feature radiation
  feature magnetism
  feature gravity
```

This individual evolution goes in parallel with community evolution. So:

- evolution of families, societies
- evolution of forests
- evolution of minerals, fluids, and rocks
- evolution of stars, galaxies, and planets

And these are all integrated into a complete whole.

## Experience

Experience is at the level of an individual. There are 4 established levels of individual currently, with potentially 2 more.

```
individual particle
individual molecule
individual cell
individual organism

potential future
  individual cyborg

potential origin
  individual information
```

Essentially cycle of:

```
process information
  process interaction
  process integration
```

Would be cool to make it into a dual cycle.

Experience is the motion of information. The change of information.

An evolving network or thread of interaction and integration.

The experience of the upper is a summary or abstraction of the lower. So experience occurs at the level of the interpretation of the lower signals from the individuals perspective. Then the individual participates with other individuals, until they form a large complex network of operating individuals. Then their society starts interacting with other societies. Initially there is conflict/war. But eventually there can be peace. And then they work together, essentially creating the abstraction of the next level individual.

This means in the beginning there was nothing or something. And this something was just an individual. Then this individual generated more individuals. This is the information explosion. Then patterns of information started to be generated by these individuals, but the abstraction is still at the individual fact level.  These patterns compete with each other. Then start to work together, in a cohesive whole. They have their own language and set of codes that are followed. This then creates the experience of the next individual.

So it seems there are currently 5 layers of individuals:

```
individual bit
individual particle
individual molecule
individual cell
individual organism
```

With the possibility of a 6th in the near future with AI and inter-planetary intelligence.

These individuals have experiences and interact with an environment. In an environment are other individuals of a similar structure. They then evolve into a variety of patterns:

```
emergence particle, from net information
emergence atom, molecule, from net particle
emergence cell, from net molecule
emergence organism, from net cell
```

After many different types are formed, which takes many generations (billions of years for 2 and 3, millions for 4). Then it seems in an instant of time, the next layer is created:

- all of a sudden there were particles
- all of a sudden there were atoms
- all of a sudden there were cells
- all of a sudden there were plants and animals

```
introduction particle
introduction atom
introduction cell
introduction plant
```

But looking closely, it seems it might be that, after a certain level of diversity is generated, and sophisticated codes generated and interpreted, then they just need to generalize the language between them so they can share a common pattern of interaction. This brings them together into societies. For a period of time there is conflict. But eventually they work together and create a new layer of abstraction, for the next level of individualism.

During the development of society, individuals within a society have to:

- form rules for their own behavior (for humans, this is integrity, for cells maybe it's also integrity, preventing death, for atoms it's preventing decay or something perhaps)

Individuals also learn to behave/act in ways that control their underlying parts. In a sense, they can control the parts, just as the parts can control the whole. The weight of a large rock causes it to crack, shifting some of the atoms around, but the atoms individually don't crack. This is the sort of self awareness phase of the individual in the new layer.

Then individuals learn to communicate with each other. And then they must:

- form rules for their collective behavior ("laws" or "morals")

So cycle of:

- individual
- collective

Proteins are an example of very complex rules that existed in the environment before cells. Large molecules began forming complex "interaction patterns". These are sets of actions, which are rules or transformations between two patterns. In human society, this would be law and the justice system. So essentially, there is a justice system. When do cells die, when do they divide, what space do they get to occupy, etc. So there is a complex network of rules.

Then, almost, cultures appear. Cultures are groups of individuals that all adopt the same sort of behavior. We haven't looked much for that in cells or proteins I don't think, but if we can apply parallel to it from human world, then maybe there is the idea of cultures in cells. This might be something to explore.

Also, during this society time, they are building tools. They are building new technologies and making use of available resources to construct tools to solve problems. This means they are performing work. Atoms building tools would be like becoming ionic in order to attract a certain other particle, or sharing electrons in order to be able to move in a different shape.

It also might mean there is a notion of play, which is self-directed learning. So all individual structures would experience work and play.

Then as the societies interact, and they flesh out the complications of work and play, they can just exist within a larger system of individuals. In a sense, they are "complete". They are "happy".

This would mean the essense of happiness is the ability to solve problems continuously, and continue to learn new ways of doing things, at your own pace, without being required to work more than is necessary.

All of this stuff would just be the general properties of complex problem solving networks; on the relation of wholes and parts.

```
same whole, collection
same part, individual
```

So in the beginning there was neither nothing, nor something. There was one thing. Whatever it was, it existed.

This thought, is information.

## Origin of Individual

So in the beginning there was a whole. And individual. And this individual performed the task of self-replicating. That is, it was a complete individual. It's only task was to assert that it exists. This is "recording information". So now we have information records, which we can see as blocks:

```
block
```

If this records information, then it would create another record.

This is where we get the notion of the "frame". The frame is the current state of the world, in a stream of state changes.

So then we have two:

```
pair block
```

But we have more than just two. There is a lot more information there.

- we have a parent who generated a child
- we have a child that was derived from a parent
- we have two, instead of one
- we have a group, made up of individuals

So this information is kept in the state.

The information is continuously created, and so within 30 generations, there are over 1 billion pieces of raw information. This is very rapid, and seems to be within the blink of an eye. This is the explosion of diversity that occurs. This also happened during the cambrian explosion.

Then a long period of refinement occurs. This is where rules are established between individuals, and societies come and go. This is the rise of animal species, or the rise of different types of molecules, or particles.

Then eventually the individuals with a set of _cooperative rules_ can emerge. These societies begin to last. These are like the civilizations.

Eventually, then, civilizations begin to come together and be at war, because of their strong differences in ways of doing things. So they try to take over each other, and they try to intermix (marriage and trade). Cells trade molecular resources. Complex signaling networks occur because of this. Communication becomes much more established.

Eventually, a standard communication system emerges for many of these civilizations. This is writing in human world, or cell signaling molecules in cells perhaps. Then they try to intermix with different types, and it is difficult. Some practices can be exchanged or merged, but others get destroyed. Eventually all work is taken care of, and play can begin. This is like with the eukaryote, where it has time to tinker with and experiment with different information. Once work is taken care of, and there is time for play, this is happiness.

This is the _fulfillment of the individual_ at this layer.

When all individuals in the final society merges into a whole new layer of abstraction, the individuals are fulfilled, and they are confined to running a more complex system at a new layer of abstraction.

At some point the societies mix, and now the individual in this next generation is _self reproducing_.

_The individual must be self reproducing._

```
pattern individual
  must reproduce
```

Maybe there is also a progression of individual from:

- small
- medium
- large

Then when they reach a certain size, they start coordinating. There are all kinds of ways this could evolve, what do they look like?

## Embryo development

Just like humans, atoms and molecules reproduce. But humans just seem to reproduce differently because of the pregnancy phase. This is however just a misunderstanding.

The fertilized egg transforms into a complete human being. It is the transformation from the layer below to the layer above.

In the same way, atoms can reproduce by using seeds from the layers below: energy/particles.

## Creation/Generation/Realization/Transformation

In a sense, this is the process of creation. And it is more general than evolution. Evolution by mutation is a specific part when the individuals have formed and are beginning to change shape. But it doesn't tie the connection to different levels of integration. Maybe it should just be called evolution too.

## Before the individuals form rules

Before individuals form rules, they need to form simple patterns. This is where the autocatalytic sets come from (rules), after the simpler patterns like causal graph dynamics. This is where simple patterns form like in a cellular automata. All the rules are built in.

Then eventually this automata generates essentially a computer. This computer can then be used to formulate rules of action. Once it can in a sense, function as an individual, then it can start to interact with others. In a sense, it communicates.

Maybe it always communicates, just at first it is very primitive communication. It is not, in a sense, aware of the external environment. It doesn't know how to decode the surrounding information. In a sense, it's not aware of any signals. So it moves around blindly.

Then it develops a way of gathering signals. It can do this because it has a memory. This is associative memory, which can be automatically generated.

At first it uses these signals to govern its own action perhaps. Then maybe it uses them to send very primitive signals to other individuals. Then eventually they establish a code: a set of signaling conventions.

Once they have this code of action, they can communicate with a language. This forms the start of society.

## Society

Societies are individuals working together using a shared code. A code is used for the interpretation of information in the environment, to determine actions.

So some sort of between individual encoding/decoding ("signaling") is occuring. It's only called signaling once they are _familiar_ with the language.

## Experience

```
pattern experience
  pattern familiarity
  pattern simplicity
  pattern difficulty
  pattern dreams
  pattern consciousness
```

## Evolution of Information

1. explosion of information in 30 generations, 1GB individuals
2. diversification of patterns
  - lots of different mathematical objects
  - this is where the causal graph dynamics comes in
3. communication between individual patterns
  - relations between mathematical objects, transformations between them
  - this is where the automata come in
  - this is where self replication comes in maybe?
  - capable of production?
  - when it becomes to communicate, it becomes more aware of its own experience essentially.
4. societies of individual patterns
  - spaces of mathematical objects
  - this is where reactive systems come in, and verifying distributed systems
  - until societies emerge, where they're starting to get more self aware
  - Since they start being aware of their experience, and they are amonst others, they can share stories. Maybe the sharing of stories is what causes awareness of experience? We start to essentially teach each other lessons on what behavior is good and bad. Initially this is done through like fighting, but then it evolves in other ways too, like social games. So maybe cells do this too to some degree. Essentially tricking each other, similar to how the animals can use the scent from phormones to attract a mate. This is where predator prey relationships emerge too perhaps. Using one individual for the benefit of another. This is where friendliness comes in, "altruism". Where individuals benefit each other. So essentially, an explosion of relationship types start to occur, one or a few per species perhaps.
5. interaction of societies
  - interaction of mathematical spaces
  - this is where trade starts to occur
  - this is where metabolism starts to occur
  - this is where cooperation, and processes in reactive systems occur. temporal properties like liveness, and fairness, so everyone has a chance to work and live in exist in a shared network!
6. integration of societies into standard set of rules
  - generalized mathematical space
  - chemoton, like fully formally verified mathematical specifications, all of the features in communication are modelled and organized.
7. fulfillment of the individual in society
  - energy and space for where particles can exist because of the standard communication of the information/mathematical patterns
  - this is toward a fully optimized and idealized reactive system

Continued evolution and diversification along the way.

So the first question to ask is, what is the diversification of patterns? So we need to find out which patterns are possible in this information (rational), and then which are actually generated during computation.

After we figure out the types of possible mathematical patterns that can emerge in this diversification phase, we can look at how communication can form. How signals and codes can be shared and interpreted. Once we get here, we are capable of production.

Once we're capable of production, we start forming into groups, and benefit from each other. This increases the "quality of life". This continues and is refined until eventually, there is an ideal society that can support a new layer of individual.

## Emergence of Particles

Particles emerge in a hilbert space.

The hilbert space is a set of mathematical rules governing the behavior of patterns of individuals.

In this sense, it is a highly organized set of rules governing the behavior of several societies of individuals, into a unified whole.

This emergence of particles in a hilbert space is the result of countless mathematical patterns interacting in an integrated way. This pattern of individual interaction as a whole emerged as the result of complex signaling networks of codes. Codes emerge from simpler patterns. Eventually starting from the simplest pattern, that of the thought of no information, suddenly becoming some information.

So there is a whole evolution of a layer of intelligence that we haven't explored yet. This can be studied with computer simulations of causal graph dynamics and quantum cellular automata.

## Emergence of Atoms

Atoms and molecules emerge in the euclidean space after the hilbert space of the particles.

They form into stars, and then diversify into different atoms and molecules; different combinations of the underlying particles. This is the phase where particles are innovating because of free time and play, and where atoms are diversifying in their new wholeness.

Supernovae create tons more atoms, and then planets collect the atoms into sheets and fluids. Eventually these individuals start forming a much more complex set of communication codes. They develop metabolisms and information templates.

The height of their society is the vast array of complex molecular societies.

## Emergence of Cells

Then cells emerge from a self-reproducing whole. In the same way atoms and molecules emerge from self reproducing particles.

Cells then eventually develop very vast and elaborate designs, where essentially their parts are innovating. Eventually, after enough innovation of the parts, they begin to communicate with each other.

Eventually this leads to simple tissues.

Then eventually to highly ordered groups of individuals coming together into a whole.

## Emergence of Organisms

Then organisms emerge from these integrated cellular societies.

This is where we are today.

## Individual Perception

### Experiential Modeling

God is what an individual without a complete and coherent scientific model may call the whole system of which it is a part, as if it was intentionally controlling everything. This would mean that most individuals without a conscious mathematical model of the world would more easily understand the world if god did everything.

To these same people, a spirit is the effect an individual has in the world.

And a _soul_ is the sum total of experience of the individual.

People can be "possessed" in this world as well, and there can be spells. This is the world of myth and magic, to different levels of degree. Experiential modeling allows us to make sense of reality without heavy processing. This seems to suggest that if we could lower the amount of mental processing it takes to scientifically model the world, then maybe it would be the default choice.

Creation myths and origin stories are part of this as well.

### Observational Modeling

This is when we create a code that can be used for all things in the universe. This is what math is essentially.

This is much more difficult and doesn't come naturally. It requires time to focus on patterns without fear of any basic needs. It requires freedom to explore possible patterns, and look for the connections between things.

It is something some individuals enjoy, while most others would rather continue doing what they are currently doing.

But eventually, a language is discovered which simplifies and standardizes, and then the individuals in the society can start using that language to make better decisions.

This might then lead to a better overall whole, until eventually all individuals are fulfilled and happy. This then is ripe ground for the next layer of individuals.

So this means that math is just a code, a pattern of information.

## Story

A story is an encoded message shared between individuals to gain experience.

This means that there may be stories shared between cells, molecules, and particles. This can be explored by creating narratives that get inside the experience of the cells or particles, and describes the experience of their world directly. Once we can do this, then we will know if there are potential stories that could be told between them. Then we can use those as predictions for experiments.

Direct perceptual experience sharing.

A story must be _relevant_. It must use patterns which are _familiar_ to the individual. It must be _engaging_, meaning it engages the machinery of the individual for interpretation (all senses, emotions, etc.). This way, the individual can focus it's _attention_ on it, in order to gain the _experience_. With that new knowledge from experience, they can be better individuals. They can live and work and play better.

This means, stories must be customized to an individual. They must be simple to understand, so using the messaging and conventions they use. These subtleties is where humans start differing from the cells. We have much more space and information that constructs us to interpret the subtleties of others much more that cells.

Stories must be _believable_, so the knowledge can be useful in a potential future experience. Otherwise the knowledge is not useful and so is annoying.

## World

Individuals exist in a world. This is composed of two worlds. Individuals experience their structure as a _self_.

The _external world_ is the space of things that can interact with them, outside of their abstraction. The external world is called the _environment_.

The _internal world_ is the space of things that construct the individual. This is called the _experience_.

```
world external
world internal
```

Stories can change the world of the individual, both externally by changing other individuals, who will then act differently as a result of the story, or internally, if this individual is changed by the story.

Good stories change the internal world of an individual that is beneficial to the individual, their society, and all of information. "And all his creation" haha.

```
story good
```

Since individuals interpret the environment, good stories can change the experience of the self. This means that good stories change the world of an individual.

This means, to create a good story, we should identify the world of the individual, then identify an alternative world. Then construct the story so that it changes the individual world as desired. This is not saying it's easy, it's super hard. But that is an independent problem.

A moral story is one where, in this new world the individual exists in now, they choose to act differently. This means, moral stories try to get individuals to act differently in the future.

The world of the individual is composed of patterns of information in the form of "patterns" and "actions". This means, to understand the world of the individual, you must understand the patterns that individual experiences, and the reasons for the actions they typically perform. Once you know this, then you can construct a set of messages, to transform the world of the individual. This is a story.

Stories will help them experience the solution, and so gain the knowledge, without having to just be force fed the action to perform.

Then the question is, how do you actually generate the stories in english language? How do you pick the words, and make sure the message is simplified so it can be understood? There is a lot going on there.

## Good and Bad

Interacting individuals establish rules on what is good and bad. Good things allow the individual and all of the system to effectively solve problems. Bad things prevent individuals from doing going things.

Morality is a set of good and bad actions. It is relative to individuals. So they need to learn to work together and find the optimal solution for the whole system, not just for the self.

## Innovation

- research
- design
- implement
- analyze

Innovation is a process of iterative refinement.

Individuals can innovate. Groups can also work together to innovate. This is why tissues can have innovations in the body, and companies can have innovations in a society. Viruses can also develop innovations.

The startup is the ultimate refinement of iteration so far. But it is not the most enjoyable thing for an individual.

## Collaboration

This is working with a team. In a family, in a group. Competition is working against a team. Sometimes we work together, sometimes we work against each other. This happens for a long period of time, until it evens out.

## Planning

## Problem Solving

## Stories

Now that we have the basic processes and actors, now we need to have details of their behavior. Now we can start mapping out how they interact, what they can sense, what they can do. We model these using the model language. And then from _there_, it can be used to generate a narrative by picking the correct text. But the story model would be the hardest part I think.

---

## Random Notes

There is "physical". What we call "physical" is just the abstraction over information two layers of interpretation landed on. It's our "3d space" and "time".

> These claims, stemming from the tradition of incredulity that living entities
can be scientifically explained, [14], highlight a problem
> Von Neumann, who attempted to investigate self-reproduction within this
framework, got as far as discovering its essential (replicator-vehicle) logic,
[9].

Particles are maybe like self-replicators that are all bundled up into a tight system.

...

Since the origin of wholes requires an origin of parts, then the origin of the whole, where there is this simple information record, could be accomplished by us as humans. Since we give rise to the next layer, we can essentially do whatever we would like, because we are essentially a blank slate to the next layer.

...

Maybe you aren't aware of yourself until in contact with others. Then you start gradually gaining self awareness. But usually it no longer needs to go further. However in humans, we developed richer and richer stories, and broke through a barrier where we were self aware, having a standard language through which to share stories.

An individual is only aware of the information it collects and can process. Cells don't know about other cells, because they don't have receptors necessarily for specific cells. Or maybe they do know the cells. Maybe they have an idea, then, of race, and what ones they talk to and what ones they don't. Or maybe they don't. Maybe they just aren't aware of any of that yet.

This would put a measurement on the level of consciousness theory.

...

Story is also a form of intimacy. It means the sharing of experience between two individuals.

Games are a new kind of story where it's an entire new world, including vision and all the objects in it. This is very different from just passing knowledge around, but it just builds on it.
