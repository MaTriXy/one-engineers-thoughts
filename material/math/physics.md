force strong
  gluons are messages between quarks, and so are really like codes that the quarks took advantage of for some reason

force electromagnetic
  photons are messages between "charged particles", between particles that can interpret the photon as a code

force gravitation
  gravitons are messages between "massive particles", which bring them together.

force weak, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction
  definition w and z bosons mediate the weak interaction
  responsible for radioactive decay
  > The weak interaction affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, as well as the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the weak interaction only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force.
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_state

> The two W bosons are best known as mediators of neutrino absorption and emission, where their charge is associated with electron or positron emission or absorption, always causing nuclear transmutation. The Z boson is not involved in the absorption or emission of electrons and positrons.

So forces are really codes that are interpretted by energy patterns.
