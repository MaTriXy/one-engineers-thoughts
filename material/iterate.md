  To solve problems so that it is enjoyable and efficient, to effectively solve customer problems
```

Where `customer` is defined as an intelligent agent that uses your product. 

So iterating is about providing solutions to customers as effectively as possible. That is, it is about interacting with other intelligent agents in order to solve their problems, while you also solve your own problems.

_How kids should learn to form words:_

```markdown
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *customers*.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *use* your *product*.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *apply* your *solutions* to their *problems*.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *act* to _change_ the _state_ to a *desired* state.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *problem solving* *agents* that *act* to _change_ the _state_ to an _other_ _state_ that is _stored_ in _memory_.
# where to go from here...
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *problem solving* _structures_ that *act* to _change_ the _state_ to an _other_ _state_ that is _stored_ in _memory_.
```

Starts to get hard as you go further down. What do you really mean? It becomes hard to pin it down, we don't really know _what_ we mean. Until we can get it down to a mathematical formula. **Only when it is a mathematical formula do we really know**.


```markdown
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that are *using* your *product*.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *use* your *product*.
```

```markdown
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *apply* your *solutions* to their *problems*.
To _iterate_ is *solve* *problems* for *intelligent* *agents* that *apply* your *solutions* to the *problems* they have.
```

So iterating is done so that we are pleasant working (solving problems) while others are pleasant consuming.
