aspects of religion
  gods
    brain thinking other things are alive that aren't alive
    communicating with inanimate object
      experiencing patterns from them, assigning meaning
  self
    happiness
      how to train your mind/experience so you reach happiness
    suffering
      letting the sum of your experiences affect your current experience
    ritual
      performing certain actions to solve certain problems
        problem gods (our creators/parents) are not satisfied with our behavior
        problem we are not happy
  community
    social norms
    morality
    group living
  relation god, self
    we said the cause of the world, and the happiness world, and the suffering world, was from an ultimate creator
    and we called that creator god

Initially it was used to help people understand the world, and experience happiness.

But then people started to use it to gain power and control society. A malfunctioning brain.

Once we think that certain patterns are being created by an entity like us, we go down the rabbit hole. Then we can say that they appoint certain people as their messengers. Because the problem is, how do we communicate with god? We have to follow all the rituals and best-practices to the extreme. To devote our lives to that practice. To devote our lives to the gods. To devote our life to god.

And this is where the church comes about. There are designated people that are good at following all the rituals. That spend all of their time doing these best-practices.

Then soon we think they are closer to god. And then it's easy to believe they have the power to see what god says. And to appoint messengers of god.

So it's like we created a problem space, and started solving those problems without allowing people to reframe the problem. That's the fundamental flaw.

Religion requires intelligence. But it is far from maximal intelligence. Requires realization of self, and a sense of social normals, and symbolic communication.

> Many religions have narratives, symbols, and sacred histories that aim to explain the meaning of life, the origin of life, or the Universe. From their beliefs about the cosmos and human nature, people may derive morality, ethics, religious laws or a preferred lifestyle.

definition devote
  > give all or a large part of one's time or resources to (a person, activity, or cause).

So you devote your time to observing the connection with the universe, not letting your past experience influence your experience, not being distracted by physical things. Being purely aware. Then we start applying this to idols or gods, we devote ourselves to god or gods for some reason. Why?

> It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other ancient sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written

So to worship is to admire and respect the power of a pattern. To sort of experience the pattern as it is, rather than not experiencing it.

To worship or respect to experience the patterns of another experience direcly, with all of your attention, rather than ignoring or misinterpretting aspects of it. So like, experiencing the force of intelligence, or experiencing the creative force.

alias etymology, origin
origin respect
  > late Middle English: from Latin respectus, from the verb respicere ‘look back at, regard,’ from re- ‘back’ + specere ‘look at.’

So to respect means to look back at, meaning to look away from your experience and at another's experience. Not focusing on your experience but on another's.

So you typically imagine "worship" as a person kneeling down to a statue or something. But this evolved after a bunch of stuff. First they "respect" the force of the universe. The patterns of changes, and how they are part of that same fabric. Then they try to make it easier to visualize that force, and _symbolize_ it in an object. Because humans are the most complex objects, they draw their inspiration from humans. So we have human statues. Then when you respect the force, you just have to look at that object to help you remember what to do. But soon we forget what the original purpose was. And we teach our kids to just "memorize" stuff. They need to worship the statue because it's good to do. So now they never learn the original reason, and then we build this whole system of action that's not based on intelligent reasoning, but just "because we say so". Then you have a society where people worship statues, and it seems ridiculous.
