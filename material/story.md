> Let's look at the Lord of the Rings. The way J.R.R. Tolkien describes a hobbit is very descriptive, and the reason the movies were so successful was not only because the story was told correctly (the book being narrative writing also), but because the readers did not have to come up with their own imagination of a hobbit (or other figures, places, and such). They were described in detail, giving everybody a very precise framework of imagination to work from. Therefore everybody could relate to and agree upon the characters and the make-up of the artists.

> Incluing is a technique of world building, in which the reader is gradually exposed to background information about the world in which a story is set. The idea is to clue the readers into the world the author is building, without them being aware of it. Incluing can be done in a number of ways: through dialogues, flashbacks, character's thoughts,[3] background details, in-universe media[4] or the narrator telling a back-story.

> The first secret is "story." When I say story I am not talking about a linear "once upon a time" type story. I am talking about an all encompassing notion, a "big picture" idea of the world that is being creating. A set of rules that will guide, the design and the project team to a common goal. It is this first step that will insure the created world will be seamless.

explain abstraction
  It doesn't work to start with the abstraction. People don't see why it's important, and don't see how it applies to the real world.

to understand means to see the connections, which means you have a complete model of knowledge. this model can then be used to solve problems, which is why people say "you only really understand something if you can do it".
