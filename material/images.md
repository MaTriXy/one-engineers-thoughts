> The most efficient and accurate way to classify those images is with a hierarchical approach, where
the first layer would identify low level features like gradients, corners, and edges. The second layer
can then use the output of the first layer to identify shapes. Finally, the location of the shapes can
be used to classify objects in the image. This is what humans naturally do, and it’s something that
machine learning systems struggled with until recently.

That makes sense!

> A new class of algorithms capable of performing hierarchical knowledge extraction were popularized
in 2007 by Hinton et al.[22].

> Reinforcement learning differs substantially from supervised
learning in that the “correct” output is not
known. Hence, there is no direct measure of error,
instead a scalar reward is given for the responses to a
series of inputs.

> Consider an agent reacting to its environment (a generalisation
of the two-player game scenario).
