Pakastan has slavery, bonded labor. They don't think it's bad.

They don't have enough money to eat, so they get sick, but can't afford healthcare. So they can't get out, downward cycle. We want this out. Have to bring children in to help,creating generations of bonded laborers.

Set examples by torture, to keep others afraid. So everyone is working a fraid, but fear doesn't help you think rationally and solve problems. So you are never fulfilling your potential.

"Syeda Fatima" - The end of our problems.

Nations are the remnants of an attempt at self rule.
