                      note The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over Fort William, but supervised other British East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833, and the official became known as the Governor-General of India.
                      note In 1858, the territories of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British government; see British Raj.

      summary So the point is, this guy went to a university that was founded under the principles of the british empire, which only let select few individuals that they could _grade_ and _fund_ through "generous grants". This means, if you do something that will also benefit them, if you create a scientific tool that benefits them too, then you will be rich and happy, like us. That's what you're told. And so he thinks he's special. He has a billion dollars, he must have done things "right". Nope. Well, it's right from the perspective of making the investors even more wealthy, but not right in the larger perspective.

meta I should be able to paste a sentence of wikipedia text in, and it should eventually come up with the same thing I do. So in a sense, it should learn how I transform sentences into models, then do it that way it's self.

university stanford
  info https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University
  origin story Stanford was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford, former Governor of and U.S. Senator from California and leading railroad tycoon, and his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford, Jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. Stanford admitted its first students on October 1, 1891[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Tuition was free until 1920.[22][23] The university struggled financially after Leland Stanford's 1893 death and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[24] Following World War II, Provost Frederick Terman supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as Silicon Valley. By 1970, Stanford was home to a linear accelerator, and was one of the original four ARPANET nodes (precursor to the Internet).[25]

    note Migrating to California from New York at the time of the Gold Rush, he became a successful merchant and wholesaler, and continued to build his business empire.
    note As president of Southern Pacific Railroad and, beginning in 1861, Central Pacific, he had tremendous power in the region and a lasting impact on California.

    event gold rush
      link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush
      origin Began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.
      note The news of gold brought—mostly by sailing ships and covered wagons—some 300,000 gold-seekers (called "forty-niners", as in "1849") to California.

      note A major genocide was furthermore conducted on Native Americans who resided in the Great Basin, a watershed which had supported the tribes for more than 14,000 years.[6] Peter Burnett, California's first governor, declared that California was a battleground between the races and that there were only two options towards California Indians, extinction or removal.[7] The State of California directly paid out $25,000 in bounties for Indian scalps with varying prices for adult male, adult female, and child sizes. It also provided the basis for the enslavement and trafficking of Native American labor, particularly that of young women and children, which was carried on as a legal business enterprise.[8] Miners, loggers, and settlers formed vigilante groups and local militias to hunt the Natives, regularly raiding villages to supply the demand.[9] The Native population of California, once perhaps as high as 705,000 in numbers, but by 1845 already down to some 150,000, further spiraled downward until by 1890 it had reached below 20,000.[10][11][6]

      source http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/infinityofnations/california-greatbasin.html
        note The Native population, estimated at 150,000 in 1845, was by 1870 less than 30,000.

        note In the Great Basin—the arid lands east of the Sierra Nevada and west of the Rocky Mountains—the Native population was never large. Yet this seemingly harsh land has supported Native peoples for more than 14,000 years. Basketry water jars—always kept close at hand—exemplify cultural knowledge and resourcefulness. In an environment where food sources were often found at great distances and travel was by foot, Great Basin Indians developed technologies that sustained their way of life well into the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when hydroelectric projects opened the desert to non-Native farming and settlement. In the 21st century, the contest for water and the development of appropriate, sustainable technologies continues to define life in California and the Great Basin.

      life story Margaret Elaine Kern Wozniak was born on Jan. 12, 1923, in Vancouver, Washington, a farming community across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon. She lived with her parents, Mary and Edward Kern, and Bob and Marilyn, her siblings. All of them played musical instruments and later her famous son would take up the guitar.

      Margaret Kern graduated from Washington State University and soon became the publicity director of the California Wine Institute. In 1949, she married Jerry Wozniak, of Pasadena, and their first child, Steven, was born Aug. 11, 1950.

      By 1958, the family had moved to Sunnyvale, where Jerry became an electrical engineer for Lockheed Missiles & Space. He spent many happy hours teaching his precocious 8-year-old son to build crystal and ham radios.

      By that time Mom was working on political campaigns at state, local and national levels. She championed women's rights and received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Women's Fund in Santa Clara Valley.

      grandfather? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kern

    summary She was into woman's rights, but she wasn't even aware of the privilege she had against the native americans.
    summary You can be good within your level of awareness. But if you are not aware, and you do no not desire to be aware, then you are being bad.
