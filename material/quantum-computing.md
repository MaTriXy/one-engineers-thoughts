Computation may be defined as the systematic creation of symbols (the “output”)
which, under a given method of interpretation, have abstract properties that were
specified in other symbols (the “input”). “Symbols” here are physical objects. A
universal set of components is one that is adequate for the building of computers
to perform any physically possible computation. A universal computer is a single
machine that can perform any physically possible computation.

Holy fucking shit.

> Therefore the limits of computability coincide with the limits of science itself.

> Almost every class of physical processes must instantiate the same, standard set of mathematical relationships, namely those that are quantum computable.

>  But a full proof must await a deeper theoretical integration of physics and computation than is yet available.
