So Sovereignty is about the power to govern itself without any external governance. So power to create set of rules of action, independent of other external systems of rules of action.

So it's like a division of the intelligence algorithm. It wants to try a new set of rules of actions better than the current situation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty

The person in charge, the king, or the group of people, are morally responsible to maintain that sovereignty. So if it's aristocracy, it is their actions that are aligned closely with the principles. Whereas a king is sort of still following the principles, but doesn't really know how because he wasn't educated and didn't become a master of an intelligent craft.

> Some political philosophies, particularly anarchism, consider the state an unwelcome institution and stateless societies the ideal.

But if that is less efficient than the whole... Oh, it's like, the whole is moving at a pace. The parts try to move it at a faster pace, but if they are governed by rules they can't act outside that. That is when the individual is valuable, for experimentation and exploration. This is the desire for anarchy and statelessness. But then when we have found a good new system, we get everyone up there as fast as we can, by creating a society of equally intelligent agents.

Either have the whole universe governed by a single state, or single set of rules, or have the best set of rules, yet allow experimentation to find even better set of rules. These explorations form little knots in the pleasantness structure of the universe. Some parts experiment and experience different pleasantness then the overall structure. Eventually they may find a whole new intelligence, and teach everyone and everything about it to make the new universe operate under that new state/government. So governance is good, and exploration outside the rules is good.

A state with a set of rules governing all action is good, yet exploration outside of those set of rules governing all action is good as well.

The problem is, how do you govern actions, yet allow experimentation outside of those governed actions?

```
Problem of the pull of static vs. dynamic set of rules. Benefits to both approaches. Dynamic allows improvement (increasing pleasantness) of overall system, static allows static/standard pleasantness of overall system.

**Therefore, we can get to the same point we are today, it would have just taken much longer, yet been much more pleasant.**

Therefore, longer and virtuous is better, but if we start to value the wrong things, we start valuing honor, then money, then power, and the world is a lot less pleasant for intelligent beings.

Therefore, after we get rid of all crime and corruption, we have to get rid of the military, so that there is no honor and fame, which devolves into money and power.

Military drives technology/innovation, which appears fast to the masses who have less money and ability than the few with money in power. This means fast gains for few ("better now"), instead of slow gains that are good for everyone "better later". We will eventually get there, but not as fast. However, it will be more pleasant for everyone overall. So we have to decide, which do we want, and why? How do you switch between them?

You form gangs, and then have money to hire lawyers. So you know, when you are hiring lawyers, you are hiring experts of the rules of action, and trying to get them to find a way to allow your action using their knowledge. And often they find loopholes in the rules of actions, places where they made mistakes in their law. Because there are loopholes in the law, it is not fully correct.

Violence and profits grow for gangs on the street. Josario. Then they pay for judges and cops. So money leads to violence.

Individuals or small groups don't understand the value of virtue, and instead value honor and fame, so they form gangs, and they want money. That's way plato and current people say. Then eventually people want freedom, and they have democracy, but aren't knowledgeable so it leads to chaos. After they get out of gang mindset, through democracy, they need to get back to aristocracy.

Building hotels and condos isn't the right solution, because there is still tons of poor people. They do it to keep the money flowing in their small circle.
