people
  The Wallenbergs, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Rockefellers, and Warburgs were notable investors in private companies in the first half of the century
  In 1938, Laurance S. Rockefeller helped finance the creation of both Eastern Air Lines and Douglas Aircraft, and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies. Eric M. Warburg founded E.M. Warburg & Co. in 1938, which would ultimately become Warburg Pincus, with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital. The Wallenberg family started Investor AB in 1916 in Sweden and were early investors in several Swedish companies such as ABB, Atlas Copco, Ericsson, etc. in the first half of the 20th century.

  Georges Doriot, the "father of venture capitalism"[7] (and former assistant dean of Harvard Business School)
  Doriot founded ARDC in 1946 to encourage private-sector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from World War II. ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families, although it had several notable investment successes as well.

  thought
    So basically, venture capitalism started when investments from rich in those who participated in war, the "wwii veterans". The ones who have experienced the war. These ones get extra privilege and can be accepted into the wealthier class if they perform certain restricted activities that also improve the wealth of the existing wealthy.

  story
    Former employees of ARDC went on to establish several prominent venture-capital firms including Greylock Partners (founded in 1965 by Charlie Waite and Bill Elfers) and Morgan, Holland Ventures, the predecessor of Flagship Ventures (founded in 1982 by James Morgan).[10] ARDC continued investing until 1971, when Doriot retired. In 1972 Doriot merged ARDC with Textron after having invested in over 150 companies.

  story
    John Hay Whitney (1904–1982) and his partner Benno Schmidt (1913–1999) founded J.H. Whitney & Company in 1946. Whitney had been investing since the 1930s, founding Pioneer Pictures in 1933 and acquiring a 15% interest in Technicolor Corporation with his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Florida Foods Corporation proved Whitney's most famous investment. The company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to American soldiers, later known as Minute Maid orange juice and was sold to The Coca-Cola Company in 1960. J.H. Whitney & Company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised $750 million for its sixth institutional private equity fund in 2005.

  story
    One of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to license private "Small Business Investment Companies" (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States.[11]

    so, cronyism

  story
    During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies. More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology. As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with technology finance. An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962[12] by William Henry Draper III and Franklin P. Johnson, Jr. In 1965, Sutter Hill Ventures acquired the portfolio of Draper and Johnson as a founding action. Bill Draper and Paul Wythes were the founders, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company at that time.

    It is commonly noted that the first venture-backed startup is Fairchild Semiconductor (which produced the first commercially practical integrated circuit), funded in 1959 by what would later become Venrock Associates.[13] Venrock was founded in 1969 by Laurance S. Rockefeller, the fourth of John D. Rockefeller's six children as a way to allow other Rockefeller children to develop exposure to venture capital investments.

story
  KPCB was formed in 1972. It has traditionally focused on early-stage investments, but also does later-stage investments.[7][8]

  The firm was named after its four founding partners: Eugene Kleiner, Tom Perkins, Frank J. Caufield, and Brook Byers.

Example of how the billionaires get an advantage. This allows them to do stock trading, which allows them to collect tons of money that nobody else can. This is one privilege of having rich friends, the right connections.

> taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government of a nation

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth

> Wealth is the abundance of valuable resources or valuable material possessions.

So, there will be no need for taxation. The computer will have abundant wealth, and will eventually have abundant space to allow for different types of life to emerge. So the AI will have access to all the wealth, and it will provide us with all of the wealth we need, and everything else in the universe.

With AI, there will be unlimited wealth.

> wealth (adam smith): the annual produce of the land and labour of the society

> Capital is a type of good that can be consumed now, but if consumption is deferred an increased supply of consumable goods is likely to be available later.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)

> Capital is derived from the Latin word "caput" meaning head, as in "head of cattle".[1] The term "stock" is derived from the Old English word for stump or tree trunk, i.e. something that grows over time.[2] It has been used to refer to all the moveable property of a farm since at least 1510.[3] In Middle Ages France contracted leases and loans bearing interest specified payment in heads of cattle.[4]

Economics is the art of balancing social interaction so that everyone is happy. But it typically only focuses on the money aspect of it, so it loses site of the bigger picture.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)

> The philosopher Michel Foucault saw power as a structural expression of "a complex strategic situation in a given social setting"[3] that requires both constraint and enablement.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology

> Perhaps the most accessible source for the near-original meaning of ideology is Hippolyte Taine's work on the Ancien Régime (the first volume of "Origins of Contemporary France"). He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the Socratic method, but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require.

So basically, you transform the terms into the way that ordinary people can understand, which they memorize, but they cannot derive from raw facts. They don't have the experience.
