> Plain English is an ongoing research program.� Plain English uses associative techniques that were developed for solving �story problems� (See http://www.cs.kent.edu/~potter/wwwace/www610/ws-0.htm).� Plain English is related to ASC and ACE, programming languages that are ideal for programming massively parallel computers and clusters of associative machines for applications such as human genome matching.

> The SIMD PE array contains 32768 one bit processors, each with 512 bits of memory and a connection to the interconnection network. The PE array design is unique in that 2048 PEs, including their PE memory, are realized on a single chip. The total PE array memory is 2 megabytes and has a peak memory bandwidth is 25 gigabytes per second. The PE array can add 8 bit integers at 2.5 gigaoperations per second. It also dissipates less than 10 watts of power and is shown in Figure 1. 

So "massively parallel" is like >= 16k processing units. But really you would want millions. We can get ~100 on a Mac.

> Now, if you have an 8-wide vector or even a 16-wide vector—the more recent Intel® architectures have up to 16 elements—then this obviously gives you significant speed-up using just one operation by a factor of the vector length or even larger because of implementation.
