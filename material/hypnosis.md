expectation

by knowing what to expect, you get engaged

> Warner (1980) defined enjoyment in a thorough way as: “To formulate the definition, let t’ be a moment of time slightly prior to t; then we can say that: x (a person) enjoys an experience or activity Z at t if and only if there is an array of concepts C such that
> 
x Zs at t’;
x’s Zing causes x at t:
(i) to believe, of his Zing, that the concepts in C apply to it;
(ii) to desire, of his Zing, under the concepts in C that it occur;
x desires for its own sake what (2, ii) describes him as desiring” 
                                                   (Warner, 1980, p. 518).
The central idea behind this definition is that enjoyment consists of a certain harmony between three elements: the activity or experience itself; the concepts which this activity or experience causes you to believe to apply to it; and a certain desire in which these same concepts figure (Warner, 1980). When dissecting this definition, three vital concepts can be extracted. First is the factor of engagement in an activity.

source careful with language
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime
  > E-Prime (short for English-Prime, sometimes denoted É or E′) is a version of the English language that excludes all forms of the verb to be. E-Prime does not allow the conjugations of to be—be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being—the archaic forms of to be (e.g. art, wast, wert), or the contractions of to be—'m, 's, 're (e.g. I'm, he's, she's, they're).

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics

  > The sourcebook for general semantics, Science and Sanity, presents general semantics as both a theoretical and a practical system whose adoption can reliably alter human behavior in the direction of greater sanity. Its author asserted that general semantics training could eventually unify people and nations.

This is what I need to make the editor! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics. That will tell how you navigate through the information!

> Using formal assessment instruments in counseling and psychotherapy is an efficient and systematic way to obtain information about clients and to subsequently tailor a counseling approach most likely to serve clients optimally. The more information a counselor obtains during the initial interview and first sessions, the more likely the client will be deeply understood by the counselor, which in turn increases the likelihood that an appropriate course of counseling will be taken, and ultimately leading to a more successful outcome.

> Our ancestors knew from their experience that hearing a human voice, even your
own voice, can encourage a person and alleviates fear.

## Music

So it's good to listen to pump-up music like you are preparing for war. Then when you're coding, it's like you're in a battle and defeating the enemy, ignorance.

> Explanations of the origin of music depend on how music is defined. If we assume that music is a form of intentional emotional manipulation, music as we know it was not possible until the onset of intentionality - the ability to reflect about the past and the future. Between 60,000 and 30,000 years ago humans started creating art in the form of paintings on cave walls, jewelry and so on (the "cultural explosion"). They also started to bury their dead ceremonially. If we assume that these new forms of behavior reflect the emergence of intentionality, then music as we know it must also have emerged during that period.

So working is essentially a battle against evil. Working is you having to put your entire being into the experience, until the problem is solved; until the evil is gone. This is why working while listening to music is key.

Breakdown is silence with very powerful sounds. So this is like the moment in battle when it's one-on-one. When you do the scream to and fight to the death.

The chaotic sounds are like the crowd mixed together and fighting.

Therefore, focusing and scattering. Focus and scatter attention.
