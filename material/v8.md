    There is where a bunch of instructions are being expanded into something large.

// Segments represent chunks of memory: They have starting address
// (encoded in the this pointer) and a size in bytes. Segments are
// chained together forming a LIFO structure with the newest segment
// available as segment_head_. Segments are allocated using malloc()
// and de-allocated using free().

class Segment {

// The Zone supports very fast allocation of small chunks of
// memory. The chunks cannot be deallocated individually, but instead
// the Zone supports deallocating all chunks in one fast
// operation. The Zone is used to hold temporary data structures like
// the abstract syntax tree, which is deallocated after compilation.

// Note: There is no need to initialize the Zone; the first time an
// allocation is attempted, a segment of memory will be requested
// through a call to malloc().

// Note: The implementation is inherently not thread safe. Do not use
// from multi-threaded code.

// An operator represents description of the "computation" of a node in the
// compiler IR. A computation takes values (i.e. data) as input and produces
// zero or more values as output. The side-effects of a computation must be
// captured by additional control and data dependencies which are part of the
// IR graph.
// Operators are immutable and describe the statically-known parts of a
// computation. Thus they can be safely shared by many different nodes in the
// IR graph, or even globally between graphs. Operators can have "static
// parameters" which are compile-time constant parameters to the operator, such
// as the name for a named field access, the ID of a runtime function, etc.
// Static parameters are private to the operator and only semantically
// meaningful to the operator itself.

// Utility functions

// CPU Registers.
//
// 1) We would prefer to use an enum, but enum values are assignment-
// compatible with int, which has caused code-generation bugs.
//
// 2) We would prefer to use a class instead of a struct but we don't like
// the register initialization to depend on the particular initialization
// order (which appears to be different on OS X, Linux, and Windows for the
// installed versions of C++ we tried). Using a struct permits C-style
// "initialization". Also, the Register objects cannot be const as this
// forces initialization stubs in MSVC, making us dependent on initialization
// order.
//
// 3) By not using an enum, we are possibly preventing the compiler from
// doing certain constant folds, which may significantly reduce the
// code generated for some assembly instructions (because they boil down
// to a few constants). If this is a problem, we could change the code
// such that we use an enum in optimized mode, and the struct in debug
// mode. This way we get the compile-time error checking in debug mode
// and best performance in optimized code.

// Unless specified otherwise, instructions operate on 64-bit operands.

// If we need versions of an assembly instruction that operate on different
// width arguments, we add a single-letter suffix specifying the width.
// This is done for the following instructions: mov, cmp, inc, dec,
// add, sub, and test.
// There are no versions of these instructions without the suffix.
// - Instructions on 8-bit (byte) operands/registers have a trailing 'b'.
// - Instructions on 16-bit (word) operands/registers have a trailing 'w'.
// - Instructions on 32-bit (doubleword) operands/registers use 'l'.
// - Instructions on 64-bit (quadword) operands/registers use 'q'.
// - Instructions on operands/registers with pointer size use 'p'.
