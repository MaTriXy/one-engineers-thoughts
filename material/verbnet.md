```
words -> frames -> models -> action
```

could do this, where now you can write comments that transform the natural language to the linear temporal logic expressions

this would mean we can transform experience language to tree language! that would handle the comments and such, and would allow searching through the content, and would be the gateway to doing more generic natural language processing.

- understand transforming natural language to ltl
