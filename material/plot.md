algorithm expectations
  When you work on your narrative, constantly ask yourself what readers are expecting and hoping for at this moment in the story. Then keep twisting the story into new directions that both shock and delight them.

  do something unexpected instead at each point

  Great twists always deepen, never cheapen, readersâ€™ investment in the story.
  Will readers feel tricked, deceived, or insulted by this twist?

algorithm bury clues
  mention clues when attention is focused elsewhere

what is the feeling of being tricked? an expectation, met by a random, unrelated expectation that is not guessable. alternative twist/explanation must at least be guessable

a plot twist is "believable" if it is closely connected but not directly expected
