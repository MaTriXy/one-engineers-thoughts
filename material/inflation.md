The inflationary epoch lasted from {{ scale -36 }} seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between {{ scale -33 }} and {{ scale -32 }} seconds.

Our physics can explain most of the evolution of the Universe after the Planck time (approximately {{ scale -43 }} seconds after the Big Bang).

So from {{ scale -43 }} to {{ -36 }}, what happened? Grand unification? Expansion of space, creation of computation? That's 10 million times difference, so 10 million frames could have passed. 10 million changes.

> If the grand unification energy is taken to be 1015 GeV, this corresponds to temperatures higher than 1027 K.
> This phase transition is also thought to have triggered the process of cosmic inflation that dominated the development of the universe during the following inflationary epoch.

events
  before scale -43
    ? gravitational singularity, but probably not
    ? event horizon (thing's "stop"), corresponding to nothing happening.
  at scale -43
    all forces united (didn't exist?)
      electromagnetism
      gravitation
      weak nuclear interaction
      strong nuclear interaction
  at scale -36
    strong force separated from the other fundamental forces
    temperature fell below the threshold at which X and Y bosons could be created, and the remaining X and Y bosons decayed
  scale between -36, -32
    temperature of the universe was high enough to merge electromagnetism and the weak interaction into a single electroweak interaction (> 100 GeV, 10^28 K). In inflationary cosmology, the electroweak epoch ends when the inflationary epoch begins, at roughly 10−32 second.
    In inflationary cosmology, the earliest meaningful time "after the Big Bang" is the time of the end of inflation.
    After cosmic inflation ends, the universe is filled with a quark–gluon plasma.
  at scale -32
    universe is filled with quark-gluon plasma. From this point onwards the physics of the early universe is better understood, and less speculative.
  at scale -12, to scale -6
    name quark epoch
    separate fundamental interactions The fundamental interactions of gravitation, electromagnetism, the strong interaction and the weak interaction had taken their present forms, but the temperature of the universe was still too high to allow quarks to bind together to form hadrons. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into mesons or baryons.
    ends when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the binding energy of hadrons
  from scale -6, to 1
    name hadron epoch
    when the temperature of the universe had fallen sufficiently to allow the quarks from the preceding quark epoch to bind together into hadrons
    Initially the temperature was high enough to allow the formation of hadron/anti-hadron pairs, which kept matter and anti-matter in thermal equilibrium. However, as the temperature of the universe continued to fall, hadron/anti-hadron pairs were no longer produced. Most of the hadrons and anti-hadrons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of hadrons. The elimination of anti-hadrons was completed by one second after the Big Bang
  from scale 1, to 2
    name lepton epoch
    after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other
    During the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.
    Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the universe was then dominated by photons.
  from scale 2, scale 5
    name photon epoch
    after most leptons and anti-leptons were annihilated
    Atomic nuclei were created in the process of nucleosynthesis which occurred during the first few minutes of the photon epoch. For the remainder of the photon epoch the universe contained a hot dense plasma of nuclei, electrons and photons. About 380,000 years after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe fell to the point where nuclei could combine with electrons to create neutral atoms.

Particle/antiparticle pairs maybe are just the result of {1, 0} in the cellular automaton sorta thing.

How do cellular automata with discrete grid move in straight lines at angles?
