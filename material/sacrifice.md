practice sacrifice
  way more efficient to "sacrifice 20000 people to gods"
    less work
    no debt
    rather than going to war to fight for resources

You're not traumatizing the people that stay alive.

Not leaving people in pain, missing an eye, or a limb.

Ritual around it, so it brings people together.

Way more efficient than war.

We think of it as a bad thing.

We never realized that it was actually a better, because we are not fully aware, we are still believing in our god, because we ran out of resources, we are used to killing. We wanted their resources. It's way easier to do that if you say they are not equal to us.

Slavery. Competition to produce the most resources. Innovation competition.

> According to Roman sources, Celtic Druids engaged extensively in human sacrifice.[30] According to Julius Caesar, the slaves and dependents of Gauls of rank would be burnt along with the body of their master as part of his funerary rites.

  Human sacrifice, including cannibalism, was practiced in Tibet prior to the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century.[53]

  In Ancient Hawaii, a luakini temple, or luakini heiau, was a Native Hawaiian sacred place where human and animal blood sacrifices were offered. Kauwa, the outcast or slave class, were often used as human sacrifices at the luakini heiau. They are believed to have been war captives, or the descendants of war captives. They were not the only sacrifices; law-breakers of all castes or defeated political opponents were also acceptable as victims.[71][72]

  The Mixtec players of the Mesoamerican ballgame were sacrificed when the game was used to resolve a dispute between cities. The rulers would play a game instead of going to battle. The losing ruler would be sacrificed. The ruler "Eight Deer", who was considered a great ball player and who won several cities this way, was eventually sacrificed, because he attempted to go beyond lineage-governing practices, and to try to create an empire.[76]

  me The aztec "end of the world" was true. They would starve to death every 52 years if they didn't perform the mass sacrifices. Maybe this was how they calculated the population size that would lead to collapse.

  Like all other known pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica, the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice.

  The aztecs had a different response, because they didn't need to adapt to the environment like the europeans did. They just ran out of space.

  What the Aztec priests were referring to was a central Mesoamerican belief: that a great, on-going sacrifice sustains the Universe. Everything is tonacayotl: the "spiritual flesh-hood" on earth. Everything —earth, crops, moon, stars and people— springs from the severed or buried bodies, fingers, blood or the heads of the sacrificed gods. A strong sense of indebtedness was connected with this worldview. Indeed, nextlahualli (debt-payment) was a commonly used metaphor for human sacrifice, and, as Bernardino de Sahagún reported, it was said that the victim was someone who "gave his service".

  Every fifty-two years a special New Fire ceremony was performed.

  The first Aztec New Fire ceremony described in ethnohistorical sources was in 1090, according to the Mapa Sigüenza.

  The fact that New Fire ceremonies had been celebrated before the rise of the Aztec empire suggests that the Aztecs had inherited the ceremony from earlier civilizations of central Mexico and that it was not an original Aztec invention.
