example
  mov eax, [ebx]
  description Move bytes at memory address held in register ebx, into eax.

tutorial addressing mode
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode
  Register addressing
    mov eax, ebx: Copies what is in ebx into eax
    mov esi, var: Copies address of var (say 0x0040120e) into esi
  Immediate addressing (second operand is an immediate constant)
    mov bx, 20: 16-bit register bx gets the actual value 20
  Direct memory addressing (directly loads from memory through a specified address)
    mov ax, [1000h]: loads a 2-byte object from the byte at address 4096 (0x1000 in hexadecimal) into a 16-bit register called 'ax'
    mov [1000h], ax: memory at address 1000h gets the value of ax
  Direct offset addressing (same as 3, just using arithmetics to modify address)
    mov al, [byte_tbl+2]
  Register indirect (accessing memory by using addresses stored in registers)
    mov ax, [di]: copies value at memory address specified by di, into ax
    mov dword [eax], var1: copies value in var1 into the memory slot specified by eax

8-bit general registers: AL is 0, CL is 1, DL is 2, BL is 3, AH is 4, CH is 5, DH is 6, and BH is 7.
16-bit general registers: AX is 0, CX is 1, DX is 2, BX is 3, SP is 4, BP is 5, SI is 6, and DI is 7.
32-bit general registers: EAX is 0, ECX is 1, EDX is 2, EBX is 3, ESP is 4, EBP is 5, ESI is 6, and EDI is 7.
Segment registers: ES is 0, CS is 1, SS is 2, DS is 3, FS is 4, and GS is 5.
{Floating-point registers}: ST0 is 0, ST1 is 1, ST2 is 2, ST3 is 3, ST4 is 4, ST5 is 5, ST6 is 6, and ST7 is 7.
64-bit MMX registers: MM0 is 0, MM1 is 1, MM2 is 2, MM3 is 3, MM4 is 4, MM5 is 5, MM6 is 6, and MM7 is 7.
Control registers: CR0 is 0, CR2 is 2, CR3 is 3, and CR4 is 4.
Debug registers: DR0 is 0, DR1 is 1, DR2 is 2, DR3 is 3, DR6 is 6, and DR7 is 7.

  note Keep things that will be accessed together (or right after another) next to each other in memory

source registers
  note The `ax` register (Accumulator) is where most arithmetic and logical computations take place. Although you can do most arithmetic and logical operations in other registers, it is often more efficient to use the ax register for such computations.
  note The `bx` register (Base) has some special purposes as well. It is commonly used to hold indirect addresses, much like the bx register on the x86 processors. 
  note The `cx` register (Count), as its name implies, counts things. You often use it to count off the number of iterations in a loop or specify the num- ber of characters in a string.
  note The `dx` register (Data) has two special purposes: it holds the overflow from certain arithmetic operations, and it holds I/O addresses when accessing data on the 80x86 I/O bus.
  note The `si` and `di` registers (Source Index and Destination Index ) have some special purposes as well. You may use these registers as pointers (much like the bx register) to indirectly access memory. You’ll also use these registers with the 8086 string instructions when pro- cessing character strings.
  note The `bp` register (Base Pointer) is similar to the bx register. You’ll generally use this regis- ter to access parameters and local variables in a procedure.
  note The `sp` register (Stack Pointer) has a very special purpose – it maintains the program stack. Normally, you would not use this register for arithmetic computations. The proper operation of most programs depends upon the careful use of this register.
  note The value of `al` exactly corresponds to bits zero through seven of `ax`. The value of `ah` corresponds to bits eight through fifteen of ax.
  note segment registers: cs, ds, es, and ss. These stand for Code Seg- ment, Data Segment, Extra Segment, and Stack Segment, respectively.
  note The `cs` register points at the segment containing the currently executing machine instructions.
  note The data segment register, `ds`, generally points at global variables for the program.
  note The extra segment register, `es`, is exactly that – an extra segment register. 8086 pro- grams often use this segment register to gain access to segments when it is difficult or impossible to modify the other segment registers.
  note The `ss` register points at the segment containing the 8086 stack.
  note The `ip` register is the equivalent of the ip register on the x86 processors – it contains the address of the currently executing instruction.
  note Besides the 32 bit registers, the 80386 also provides two new 16 bit segment registers, fs and gs, which allow the programmer to concurrently access six different segments in memory without reloading a segment register.

note
  A directive (i.e. a command to the assembler) is used to define variables. In 8086 assembly language, the directive db defines a byte sized variable; dw defines a word sized variable (16 bits) and dd defines a double word (long word, 32 bits) variable.

  A Java variable of type int may be implemented using a size of 16 or 32 bits, i.e. dw or dd is used. A Java variable of type char, which is used to store a single character, is implemented using the db directive.
