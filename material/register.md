https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator#Bistable

> A multivibrator is an electronic circuit used to implement a variety of simple two-state systems such as oscillators, timers and flip-flops. It is characterized by two amplifying devices (transistors, electron tubes or other devices) cross-coupled by resistors or capacitors. The name "multivibrator" was initially applied to the free-running oscillator version of the circuit because its output waveform was rich in harmonics.[1]

> Flip-flops and latches are used as data storage elements.

> Flip-flops can be generalized in at least two ways: by making them 1-of-N instead of 1-of-2, and by adapting them to logic with more than two states. In the special cases of 1-of-3 encoding, or multi-valued ternary logic, these elements may be referred to as flip-flap-flops.

> Another generalization of the conventional flip-flop is a memory element for multi-valued logic.

> A Register in CPU terminology is small Named chunk of memory Available inside a microprocessor(CPU)

> Registers are groups of flip-flops, where each flip-flop is capable of storing one bit of information.
An n-bit register is a group of n flip-flops. The basic function of a register is to hold information in a digital system and make it available to the logic elements for the computing process.

done on fixed size binary ”words”

> Data are stored in computers in registers which can be thought of simply as
collections of D-type flip-flops

> With the basic one-bit memory as a starting point, you can build more complex memory circuits. Just as you can line up several "Adder" circuits to get a multibit addition circuit, you can combine several one-bit memory circuits to get a multibit memory circuit. As one of the exercises at the end of the lab, you will construct a 4-bit memory circuit. A 4-bit memory circuit can store a 4-bit binary number. Similarly, you can build memory circuits to store 8-bit binary numbers, 16-bit numbers, or any number of bits. Memory circuits of this type are important components in the central processing unit of a computer. A memory circuit that is used in the central processing unit to store a binary number is called a register. Multibit memory circuits can also be used in the main memory of a computer. Recall that main memory contains a sequence of numbered locations. Each location stores a binary number, so each location can be a simple multibit memory circuit.
http://math.hws.edu/TMCM/java/labs/xLogicCircuitsLab2.html#registers

A register is a memory circuit.

> A memory circuit that is used in the central processing unit to store a binary number is called a register.

> A random access memory, or RAM, is a memory circuit that can hold several different binary numbers. Each binary number is stored in a separate location. The locations are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The number of a location is called its address. Every computer has a RAM, which it uses as a main memory where it stores the data and programs that it is working with. A RAM can have any given number of locations. (In a typical computer, the RAM has several million locations.) The binary numbers that are stored in a RAM can have any given number of bits. (In a typical modern computer, each location holds an eight-bit binary number.)

So registers are actually just mini memories. They hold fixed size bits: binary numbers, either 8, 16, 32, etc. So 01010101 is 8 bit.

So it's like a processor/core, is a small circuit, which has mini memory circuits (the "registers") for temporary calculation.

By "digital", it is discrete. So it is electronics that deals with discrete blocks of information. Discrete signals.

> In most cases, the number of these states is two, and they are represented by two voltage bands: one near a reference value (typically termed as "ground" or zero volts), and the other a value near the supply voltage.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction_isolation

> Assume that the semiconductor wafer is p-type material. Also assume a ring of n-type material is placed around a transistor, and placed beneath the transistor. If the p-type material within the n-type ring is now connected to the negative terminal of the power supply and the n-type ring is connected to the positive terminal, the 'holes' in the p-type region are pulled away from the p–n junction, causing the width of the nonconducting depletion region to increase. Similarly, because the n-type region is connected to the positive terminal, the electrons will also be pulled away from the junction.
> This effectively increases the potential barrier and greatly increases the electrical resistance against the flow of charge carriers. For this reason there will be no (or minimal) electric current across the junction.

> The famous Pentium FDIV bug caused the results of a division to be wrong by at most 61 parts per million, in cases that occurred very infrequently.

Yet Intel was forced to offer to replace, for free, every chip sold until they could fix the bug, at a cost of $475 million (US).

> If you are not looking for large volumes, or you are wanting to prototype a design, then there are companies that will buy a run from a foundry for one or two wafers, and then sell out space in the reticule. There are two major companies: MOSIS and CMP. They plan on buying only one or two wafers and a set of masks, so their production costs are basically fixed. Their prices are typically based on the size of your design in mm2. MOSIS doesn't publish their rates, but CMP's cheapest rate on a 0.35 micron process for 650 Euros/mm2. A non-trivial design will probably cost $3000 or more for 40 chips. The finer the feature size, the more expensive it is to make the masks.

> Historically, FPGAs have been slower, less energy efficient and generally achieved less functionality than their fixed ASIC counterparts. 

> Xilinx and Altera are the current FPGA market leaders and long-time industry rivals

> Previously Altera offered a publicly available ASIC design flow based on HardCopy ASICs, which transitioned an FPGA design, once finalized, to a form which is not alterable. This design flow reduced design security risks as well as costs for higher volume production. Design engineers could prototype their designs in Stratix series FPGAs, and then migrate these designs to HardCopy ASICs when they were ready for volume production.

> The unique design flow makes hardware/software co-design and co-verification possible. The flow has been benchmarked to deliver systems to market 9 to 12 months faster, on average, than with standard-cell solutions.
