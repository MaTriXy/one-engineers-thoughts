## 1. Study math books to build documentation site

- language parser
- could use standard syntax highlighter
- format code in pretty way

> 1-2 months if working

## 2. Setup dev workflow

> 1-2 months if working

## 3. Add ability to execute actions in model language

> 1-2 months if working

So 3-6 months if working.

## 4. Build documentation site for JS

- Create a list of all the examples that need to exist for full treatment of JS

3-6 months if working. So 1 year if working. Potentially, if there is enough traffic, could be making money in under 1 year! So this is a faster approach.

## 5. Build documentation for CSS

3-6 months if working.

## 6. Build documentation for HTML

3-6 months if working.

So 1.5-2 years if working. But by this point, there would be a good amount of content.

There is also room for competition though.

## 7. Add helpful development tools

- color picker
- code formatter
- image resizer
- ...

## Notes

If I did it this way, then we could practice a few years making videos, and so be ready for the nature site. We could then make a lot of virtual reality videos instead of regular ones.
