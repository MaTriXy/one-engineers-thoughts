A picture can have a story. It just requires looking into your camera and when you see stuff, ask "what is going on here?". Then look for the objects, and how they are acting? Are they standing next to each other or taking over space? Are they aware of each other? Is the tree providing shade?

Once you know the actions that could be performed, adjust your angle to better capture it. Make it so the action is the dominant thing. Then have another character, towering below, to make it feel like the action is having an effect. So you can feel the effect of the action. This is how to make good images into a story. How one image can tell a story.
