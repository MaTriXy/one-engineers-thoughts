- taleofone.org Stories of life lessons for humans. Or maybe it's instead about the inner experience, sort of. Since stories can be used as a way of relating to the inner experience of the other. The other experiences the story, and comes to the same conclusion. Instead of you telling them, they experience it directly. In the same way, we could have people directly experience the evolution of the universe.
  + taleofmorality.org
  + taleofvirtue.org
  + These ones are about teaching people good life lessons.

These next ones are about others, facts, but in story form. The first one above is about individuals, and their problems, and life lessons.

- taleofnature.org All the nature stuff, but so you can experience it directly. About observing nature deeply, and telling the story.
- taleofperception.org All the ideas, books, myths, sciences, we've come up with. Images from art and such about different beliefs. This can link to all kinds of research papers, and citations. So there needs to be essentially a database of citations to pick from. But that doesn't need to be a service, that can just be part of my own private database, until tropon.
- taleofcivilization.org All the people and laws and actions we performed. What people do in their lives.
  + taleofsociety.org
  + Internally, this would have a shared people database with the other sites. But that wouldn't need to be opened as a service or anything yet.
- taleofinnovation.org All the products we've created, and their intellectual properties. How things are really made, it's effect on the environment. The story of the products and problem solving. Why we create the tools we do. Why we do a we do. Also getting info about products. So basically a different kind of product catalog, linking to amazon, or to perhaps local vendors that want to trade. "If you have a really cool custom project, I will support it for you instead of linking to amazon" I can tell the community. So then it's good will.
- These ones can be about the true thing, but said in such a way where you experience what it was like. I guess this is what david attenborough does in a way. He talks about what the struggles are, the actions, of what they will go through.
- taleofcode.org Maybe this ends up being dev handbook. It can tell the take of people trying to make code in a certain way, only to have it fail on them down the road. Along with being centralized docs, it helps teach you the right ways of coding, in a fun and engaging way. Videos with this too. Telling the story. Maybe can start automatically generating these stories. First have to figure out what the ideal actions, or principles for action, are. When you know the ideals of how to act, then you can construct a story that will lead to an experience of another agent, which they will come to the conclusion that the actions are correct. Maybe this can even eventually talk about all code and apis, and all the language and compiler stuff.

Then eventually, tropon can just unify these into a single place. There is no difference between any of these categories, everything is part of the same system. And this is when the full story is told. The whole story of the universe.

Could then have that site be similar to stackoverflow or envato. Maybe somehow the community could participate in them. Maybe I should check out how harry potter communities work together.

## code website

## nature website

Could have a cool complete family tree graphic to download eventually, as a growth hack.

Home page is a long 24 hour video of sunrise/sunset on the beach, and it always starts at the right time of the day based on where you are.

## product website

- productdecision.org
- productnotes.org
- productculture.org
- productresearch.org
- productsketch.org
  - when it was created
  - why it was created
  - who created it
  - automated review videos
- mapsofinnovation.org This one is closest to the meaning
- productstory.org
- realworlduse.org This one too
- productslash.org

Maybe this would be a combination of how stuff works, and examples of real world use. Then it would show how a car is composed, and what the pieces are, sort of thing. Then it would link you to the right place. You could also see comparisons of products, like the output from two different cameras, or the side-by-side comparison of two different sound recordings. You could also see a list of companies that use such a tool. You could see the types of cars famous people drive, or the types of decorations people like.

You can see the resources that the products are made out of, and linking back to the factsofnature website, where that comes from. You can see the company profile too. But this links to another site, like about people and organizations (humanaction.org).

This links to all the good youtube videos of people reviewing it.

## individual/organization website

Don't really have a monetizable use case for this yet. Why would people want to come here? Maybe history videos, like quick youtube videos describing key moments in the history. Or what was it like when they were starting their company. To get people inspired to start their own thing. Could be a place where students who are preparing to college go to read inspiration stories, or watch inspiring videos.

Maybe this can be used more for a lookup for political things. To see who is funding what. To see who works for what. The types of actions people have done.

- humanaction.org
  + With videos of inspiring stories, both ones we create from photographs, and existing ones out there.

Maybe it could also have examples of people doing construction. Types of jobs, and the impact it has on the world. How the job is going to be replaced or automated in the future. The information here can be used as a reference for radio shows. So this needs a citation thing too.

Could also list jobs for the companies, if it was a good company. Good meaning, they are trying to get rid of companies in general :)

Lists out what careers there are you can do. Has pages with examples of careers, with photographs. Maybe we could eventually interview people there too, and have interview videos, for the different job types.

## thought/idea website

- thoughtandidea.org
- thoughtslash.org

This would like the ideas people have had throughout history. Where their ideas were influenced from. It would reveal that all ideas build upon each other, and copyright is unnatural. Everybody is already copying from everybody else.

It would also create a map of what was present at that time in terms of ideas. "This is when people thought the world was flat". Or "This is when we didn't have a cure for aids." Or "This is when black people were considered different".

This is where all of the hotly debated issues are. The different ideologies and such. So this could be a place to sort of mathematically model ideas and thoughts. Create videos showing what thoughts are being taken into account to make a decision, and such.

At the end of this, we would have a pretty good history of ideas. Combine that with history of earth or "nature", and we have a pretty good history of the evolution of intelligence. That would be very useful for the paper. Essentially, this is the **history of civilization** website, but mainly a history of the mental side, as opposed to the physical side (nature website).

You could compare ideas, see where they are similar and where they are different.

```
# /compare/anti-abortion/to/abortion
| idea(a) | idea(b) |
# split screen sorta thing
```

Where `/compare/x/to` would lead to a list of things you can compare it to.

Then we have videos where we tell the story of how two people disagree. Or maybe we can even have reinactments of how they might have acted given that they don't know that thing! Given that they have a certain world view, they would act a certain way. So we could learn how to act! This way, we could demonstrate the social power games in a clear way. :D :D Wow, that would be so cool.

## General notes

All of these sites can have a similar design, so they are like:

- envato
- stackexchange

They are similar things, but different topics, and different names of the sites. So it means familiarity between the sites.

- Can have a generic "unsorted content" page on each site, where users essentially sort the content to show on the page. For example, the products site might have an /unsorted-photos URL, which people could go through and organize, so they would show up on the right pages. They would all be published to the site immediately, and show up for that person at least, but reviewed by me manually after that, and sorted out porn and stuff. So then it's like, users can feel like they are contributing to a great resource. Similar to stackoverflow I guess. But that would require having user accounts and such, so spam isn't an issue.

## Far future

All the sites are basically just focusing the general knowledge into a specific niche. So after this, we could get more specific. They are a lens into a niche.

- tattoos We could have a site about tattoos, and what their symbols represent (the meaning behind them), and pick the best ones. people would love browsing through them i imagine
- molecules Maybe we could have a food site and have it be based off of the molecular data. It would then just link to good youtube videos that already exist of people cooking meals with those exact ingredients. So the video work is essentially done already. Would just have to collect the molecular data, and for each piece of food.

At that point, we could start moving more into niche markets, and make the information in that niche market really easy for them to use. Much easier than their current state.

- shoes and clothes: which companies sell which kinds of clothes, and where were they made, the types of clothes and when they were invented, etc.
- schools: which schools are best for your kids. how did the school get that way?
- laws: laws for driving cars, for being a parent, for doing anything. taken from the law books and made into easily accessible form, also including their origin, and links to what ideas were like at the time the law was created, and how the world looked then, via the nature site, and who was around then, via the organization and people site. Have list of crimes, and types of crimes, and such like that.
- medicine: what are the types of diseases. what are the types of medications. when were they invented (idea site), who was around then (humanaction), what did the world look like then (nature site). It would show how this could be taken, and the research that shows the pros and cons. Direct citations to research papers. High quality medical information.
- esoterica and conspiracies: what they were, why they could have happened, the research that has been done on them, the disproof videos
- math? maybe showing all the different equations, and the complete formulation of math, the foundation of mathematics. then all the extra stuff schools use to test math, so it could be like a central math resource for students
- genes, chemicals, and proteins are added to factsofnature.org website perhaps, continuing to paint the full picture
- military / weapons history / torture: wars, when they were fought, the soldiers, the experiences etc. People who are interested in guns might go here, or hunters. Maybe get interviews of people who went to war and describe their experience.

Essentially, then, the market is the general public, to get them informed enough to make good decisions and to vote.

After we have a lot of these websites, we can merge them into a single website, on tropon.org. And it also includes the source editor, which you can use to engage in the organization and viewing of the information.
