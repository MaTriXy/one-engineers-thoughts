>  For evidence to back up their claims they point out that in some societies (such as certain Samoan tribes),[8] adults do not speak to their children at all until the children reach a certain age.

> The first sentence is the transition that separates humans from other creatures. Most toddlers produce their first spontaneous two-word sentence at 18 to 24 months, usually once they have acquired between 50 and 500 words. Before their first sentence, they often achieve the effect of complex expressions by stringing together their simple words:

```
Book
Mine
Read
```

> The groundwork for acquiring speech starts as early as 7 or 8 months when infants begin babbling in an attempt to mimic the sounds in their environment. The first words (recognizable to caretakers) emerge between 12 and 18 months, and are usually words that are an important part of the child’s daily life, such as “mama,” “dada,” “milk,” or “dog”—in every language.

> “In analyzing the babble recordings, we identified four sequences of sound patterns—each a consonant-vowel combination—that were common to baby babble and to first words across a number of different languages,” Davis says.

> The four combinations are: lip consonants with vowels generated at the center of the mouth with a flattened tongue (such as “mama”); tongue-front consonants preceding vowels produced at the front of the mouth (such as “dada”); tongue-back consonants followed by back-of-the-mouth vowels (such as “gaga”); and lip consonant-vowel-tongue-front consonant sequence (such as “mad,” which has a lip consonant followed by a vowel, then a tongue-front consonant).

mama (closed lips)
dada (tata, consonant only)
baba (papa, consonant only, "bottle" is baba)
gaga (kaka, consonant only, poop "caca")

> and lip consonant-vowel-tongue-front consonant sequence (such as “mad,” which has a lip consonant followed by a vowel, then a tongue-front consonant).

> “We’ve discovered all four of these consonant-vowel combinations in our additional studies of Swedish, Portuguese, Korean, Japanese, French, Dutch, Berber (a language spoken in parts of North Africa, especially in Morocco and Algeria) and even in an Ecuadorian-Quichua environment,” Davis says.

>  consonant–vowel syllable systems

> Consonantal Universal #1
a. Every phonological system has stops (= descriptive)
b. Every phonological system has stops which are laryngeally unspecified (= analytic).

> Consonant Universal #2
Every phonological system contrasts phonemes which are [-cont] (= stops) with phonemes
that are specified with a different feature.

> Consonantal Universal #3
Every phonological system contrasts phonemes for place of articulation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant_consonant

> Therefore, approximants fall between fricatives, which do produce a turbulent airstream, and vowels, which produce no turbulence.[3] This class of sounds includes lateral approximants like [l] (as in less), non-lateral approximants like [ɹ] (as in rest), and semivowels like [j] and [w] (as in yes and west, respectively).[3]

> Consonantal Universal #4
Every phonological system has coronal phonemes.

```
p t k
b d g (with voice)
```

```
p t k (tick)
b d g (tick tone)
f s x (tick flow)
v r y (? approximants, not quite fsx, but not fully ptk)
```

> There are many languages missing any one stop of the series /p, t, k, b, d,
g/, especially /p/ and/or /g/, or any two from the same place of articulation. However, when all
consonants are taken into consideration, UPSID reveals that languages may lack bilabials (e.g.,
Wichita7
) or velars (e.g., Klao, Vanimo), but not coronals.

>  The diglossic situation in Samoan in
(11) shows that a language can lack /t/, /d/ and /n/ (Duranti 1994:44-45):

> One of FCT theory's main predictions is that during the canonical babbling period, within infants' syllabic vocalizations, certain
vowels and consonants will co-occur with greater likelihood than would be expected by chance (Davis & MacNeilage, 1995; Davis
et al., 2002; MacNeilage, 1998; MacNeilage et al., 2000). In particular, it was proposed that front vowels and alvoelar consonants
would co-occur at high rates, mid vowels and labial consonants would co-occur at high rates, and back vowels and velar consonants
would co-occur at high rates; other combinations, for example front vowels and velar consonants would co-occur less frequently. This
prediction has been supported by phonetic transcription studies of syllabic infant vocalizations

Jaw oscillations. Chewing, sucking, swallowing. Cleaning teeth.

> Despite these strengths, FCT theory leaves some significant features of infant babbling still to be explained. FCT only applies to
infants who have already reached the canonical babbling stage, which on average occurs at roughly 7 months of age

15 consonants and vowels per second in humans

`na` is the no sound in babies?

> None of these units — melodic line (or ‘tone group’), foot (or ‘rhythm
group’), syllable or phoneme — has clearly identifiable boundaries, some definite point in
time where it begins and ends

> . There is a form of order here that we can call constituency,
whereby larger units are made up out of smaller ones: a line out of feet; a foot out of
syllables; a syllable out of sequences of phonemes (perhaps with ‘sub-syllable’
intermediate between the two). We refer to such a hierarchy of units, related by
constituency, as a rank scale, and to each step in the hierarchy as one rank (cf. Halliday,
1961)

> As writing systems evolved, they gradually came to model the constituent hierarchy of
spoken language, by developing a rank scale of their own. Thus, in modern English writing,
we have the sentence (beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop), subsentence
(bounded by some intermediate punctuation mark: colon, semicolon or comma),
word (bounded by spaces) and letter. Figure 1-2 shows the same text written in
orthographic conventional form.

```
full stop
part stop
```

> The simple answer is: because writing is not the representation of speech sound

Writing is not a direct representation of sounds. Instead, it is an association between sounds.
