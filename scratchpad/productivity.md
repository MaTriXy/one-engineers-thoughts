## Productivity

- A _measure_.
- Productivity is an average measure of the efficiency of production. It can be expressed as the ratio of output to inputs used in the production process, i.e. output per unit of input.
- The value of outputs minus the value of inputs is a measure of the income generated in a production process.
- The result of your productivity may decrease other's productivity if it is low quality.
- How efficiently you can execute a project, or solve a problem, or do a task. So since there is a goal, you only do what is absolutely necessary for the goal, in as fast and as high quality as possible. If you have to build all kinds of other stuff, you might be productive from one perspective, but weren't productive from a "product perspective". So, productivity has to do with "perspective", which is "in relation to what problem you are trying to solve".

Output can be projects. But some projects are not relevant to certain people, so you could be considered unproductive at work.

Saying someone is "productive" is a judgement you give. It's based on how much their products/solutions solve your own problems. If they solve your own problems, and that person continues to solve your new problems, then you would call that person productive (TJ).

A productive person is someone who is "smart and gets things done". This means you need to have a clear end state, defined into a problem, and a solution, which you then implement.

If you spend a lot of time fixing bugs, then you may be doing a lot but you're not being productive. This is because you're not getting closer to the end state, you have fallen backwards and are trying to get back where you were.

Ways to be more productive, then, are ways to more clearly see the end state, to identify problems, to have the relevant knowledge, and only go toward a specific end state that the judge values. So if you're doing work for your company, if you have a clear goal / end-state, then getting to that end-state as quickly as possible.

As a software engineer, this means find ways to:

- clarify end states
- clarify problems
- solve problems more efficiently
  - bigger screen size
  - simplify abstractions

To continue being productive in the face of new problems, you have to keep learning. Otherwise you won't have the mental models to solve new problems efficiently. This is why you can't just solve every problem the same way, and need to sacrifice time and spend it on thinking of new ways. Over time you will become more productive, instead of stagnating.

Your productivity is directly influenced by other's productivity. What may be productive for you may cause other people to be unproductive. This is why _simplicity_ is key for team productivity. It means other people can easily understand your work.

- learning curve

Spending a lot of time doing low-level stuff, which could all be abstracted away, is not productive for me personally.

## Production

- Production is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (the output).
- It is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.[1]

A "product" is a "result". A "creation". It is the result of a project. A _deliverable_. A "deliverable" is an end state. So, it's a solution to a problem.

Product management: is responsible for discovery and definition of the scope.
Project management: is responsible for execution and delivery of the scope.

## Efficient

- (especially of a system or machine) achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense.
- preventing wasteful use
  - lots of debugging
  - solving the same problem over and over again
  - reinventing the wheel
- Efficiency is the extent to which time, effort, or cost is well-used for the intended task or purpose.
  - For a specific problem, solving the problem and implementing the solution with minimal energy, time, and tangents.
  - no unnecessary effort
    - no debugging
    - no reloading the page
    - no having to figure out the code path
    - no having to find the docs or api methods
  - percentage of ideal efficiency
  - is measurable

## Implementation

- the process of putting a decision or plan into effect; execution.

During implementation, you will run into other problems. So it's a cycle of problem solving and implementation.

## Getting work done?

What does this mean exactly?

Work is only necessary to aid in the transformation of the current state into the desired state. This could be producing new knowledge or solutions, or executing tasks.

Same meaning as "productive".

Hacking things together sacrifices future productivity, because it increases debugging time, makes things harder to reason about, etc.
