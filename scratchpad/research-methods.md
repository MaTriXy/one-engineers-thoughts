## Research methods

I have read many books. For the past 11 years, I have studied, just about. So it seems like almost 12 years? Maybe less.

I spent the past year going to the berkeley library going many days each week. (Maybe print out berkeley book rental list).

I have browsed amazon for several years, and found the best books through reviews. I have had near unlimited access to all of this information since college, because I was lucky to have access to a university library of physical books.

Many of the key pieces to this paper were found only in books that have not yet been digitized. Once they all be digitized, it is possible that a machine just read them and know everything.

I achieved high honors from Berkeley, double majoring in Religious Studies and Neurobiology. I started by trying cognitive science, but found the low-level approach too unrelated to my own interests at the time. I broke down freshman year to my father after receiving a D+ on a Calculus midterm when I was in the Berkeley extension program. I thought I was going to fall out and go back to square one.

I made it through my first classes, and took a Religious studies course on Genesis. There I learned a very different way of looking at the bible than you are used to in everyday life. Normally we hear "oh just have faith", "just listen to the word of Our Father" and you're like "my skin is crawling, please stop". You are just like "it makes no sense what you are saying". And they don't even know what they are saying.

But what I saw in that class was a very different picture. The professor showed us, maybe 150 students in a large lecture hall, "I am Jewish". "But I am interested in Religious Studies as an academic discipline." And he went on to show us the 4 authors of the ancient bible. And how, it wasn't really Matthew Mark Luke and John, but several authors. And he showed us archeological evidence.

That got me excited. I then signed up for Religious Studies as a major. Their department was _nothing_ like the Molecular Cell Biology major (MCB). The MCB building is like cutting edge, with a gorgeous glass atreum in the center, and a world famous T-rex in a spiral staircase around the library. The religious studies building was an old worn down place, with professors that looked like ordinary people you'd find at coffee shops. I remember one of the religious studies advisors had papers all over his desk, so messy. He seemed like a total hippie haha, but he was a great person.

So I took classes in the following:

I learned all kinds of stuff. Here are all the resources I read:

I also had great professors. George Lakoff changed my life, but he probably doesn't know who I am. So did Dr. David Presti, and Matthew Baggott, who studied things nobody else in the world studied. I had some great peers too, who are now great professors at places like UCLA and UCSF.

I learned Molecular Biology from some of the best professors in the world. Renouned microbiologist. I worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory doing DNA repair research while doing my double major. I spent a lot of time listening to Tool. I spent I would say most of my time at college listening to Tool, even most of my high school time which really began with Metallica with my mom's death when I was 15. I made music in my room. I joined a Fraternity and learned how to socialize and fit in to some degree. I was able to do it once or twice as some of my friends will attest. But most of the time, I never wanted to go out. I always kept thinking and trying to "follow the spiral" as Tool said in Lateralus.

I worked at the Suitcase clinic and got a pretty decent look at homelessness and the problems it causes. I tried to do an honors thesis with my lab work, but doing manual labor for 6-hours a day was not fun. I found it way more interesting imagining complicated animations that expressed the inner story of the "life of the cell".

<life of the cell video link>

I lived with two "hardcore Christians" I would say. But in the fraternity, there was many different perspectives. Many people were agnostic. Some were athiests, others religious by upbringing.

These "christinas" haha were Dan Tocchini and Pablo Cabrera, my big bro in the fraternity. He and I had a strange connection. Like we were on the same page about the meaning of life, but we disagreed about all the details when we actually started talking to each other about it. Eventually we grew frustrated with each other and have since stopped hanging out. He also now has a job at Lockheed Martin, managing engineers building rockets.

Dan and I got the closest. He was the closest person I got to in college, and after college. We explored tons of deep information. He introduced me to many of the underlying secrets of the mysteries. He loved the elusian mysteries book, and I got that big book because he had it haha, and I wanted to catch up to him. In a word, Dan was pretty much a master at that mystical stuff. But he stopped when it got to the chemistry. He majored in physics, wanting to find the missing link, but he never went to class and just crammed to study for the test a few days before. Had he went to class, he probably would have figured this out first.

Dan brought me in to work on websites with him after I graduated. His Dad was well connected, so Dan had access to a lot of good potential website clients. Dan was also really into style. He wore the best stuff, gucci, louix vuitton, etc. His designs were rich and king-like. His favorite colors were red, gold, and black. He decorated his room like a king.

I lived with him in a spare room. I didn't decorate the room at all, just basically like a plain cream-colored room with a bed and a small closet that was half full with their stuff. Every day we would wake up and get starbucks iced coffee with an extra shot of expresso (later petes). We would take maybe 2.5-5mg adderall around 2pm, but we didn't wake up until at least 11am. Sometimes 2pm, so we wouldn't take it until 4pm or so. And so stay up all night.

All we would do was think.

I haven't stopped doing this for almost a single day for the past seven years. I have to force myself to see family a few times a year and that's pretty much it. Most of my friends haven't seen me but once or twice for a quick drink since then.

I have stopped drinking for the past year or two. I just found logically it makes it harder to think, and I feel more depressed and frustrated with life the next day. I found when I stopped drinking, I could pretty easily get into a routine (after meditation).

I learned to meditate really well. I listened to tons of audiobooks. I got many of the great courses from audible. I listened to them pretty much every night before bed or during long drives.

But after listening to some of these great books (with a broader perspective than the academic stuff), I realized there is no possible way that me personally reading every book is possible. There's just no way. No amount of motivation will make me be able to listen to 1000 audiobooks in a day, it's just not physically possible. Maybe it is someday, but no way now.

So I started refining my techniques on how to find the best content. I started consciously molding my workflow. You can imagine my frustration when I work at a company, and they then tell me how I need to work to achieve the best results. Well, I have spent the past year consciously improving this, and you haven't become conscious of this system, so how can you possibly know more than I do. But I learned to deal with it, like everyone else, and bite my tongue. Well, sometimes. I got fired from Segment. I think it was because I was just stirring things up too much one day, asking too many questions. For business with a time constraint, that's less than ideal, so I was cut.

Since then I realized that we are all frustrated with the way things are, and I almost have this good model that I would use for creating content. Well, how can I use it?

I later worked at some of the best software startups in the world, from people coming from MIT and other top schools.

I eventually found a passion in pure math, and spent over a year taking the monthly-ish journey to the berkeley library, to gather my 20 books (the most I could check out at a time, whereas professors can check out 200 at once, for a year at a time!).

Math led me directly to the core. I could not believe this had never been found before, but it was because (in my opinion) the language was way too complicated. Maybe it was intentionally made that way, I don't know yet. Maybe it was just a big prank we played on each other. Or maybe it was just an honest mistake.

I learned the art of simple coding by studying TJ Holowaychuk. Along the way I met some brilliant individuals, such as Daniel Fagnan, Alex, and Steven Miller. We all had pretty privileged backgrounds.

TJ mastered the art of designing code for humans. Tens of thousands of programmers watch his every move every day. He is a legend.

I read Ken Wilbers book.

Russ showed me what a great person looks like.

Joanie Spigler was my art teacher, and she found my interest in tool and alex grey's art intriguing, which gave me extra hope and courage. She was one of the few graduate student instructors that took an interest in me.

I get frustrated a lot when people don't understand what I'm saying, so I tend to just be quiet. This has the benefit of preventing people from hearing what I say, but also prevents me from sharing things I've learned. My soon to be wife has helped me grow with this immensley. For several months as I was preparing the content for this paper, I tried to explain to her all the exciting things I was finding, how all the gods really means _this_, and how good is god, and how the ancient tao worked. But all I was saying just came out sounding like hocus pocus (as my dad would call it). "NO! You aren't listening!" I would say, getting frustrated, "But I AM listening" she would inevitably say back, "and all I hear are that this god has 4 arms flaylying around". She sat there with me and pushed through to help me identify the thing I was always missing, which turned out to be so simple. I just have never really told anyone about all the things I've been looking into, and I guess I kinda forgot. So thank you honey for powering through, even though at times it was pretty painful haha.

Calvin from Segment always told me about this, and by then I was starting to really become aware of it. But I didn't know how to explain it, so I was sort of trapped, which meant I couldn't really fully express myself properly. But I appreciate the 1-on-1's with Calvin for that.

Mr. Madigan helped me see what I am capable of. Dan's Dad showed me what it was like to be fully present. Cheryl showed me what it's like to really listen to somebody else. My dad showed me how to make things happen.

Craig was there with me to explore all the infinite combinations of drum beats and guitar riffs, and to explore all the ideas everyone else thought was crazy.

## My Background

My dad bought me a guitar when I was 9. I remember one day seeing him from my living room window in my moms upper floor apartment, walking with what looked like an electric guitar case. I opened it up and it was a fender stratocaster, just like Eric Clapton had.

My mom committed suicide when I was 15. She drank a lot, always having Squirt (that sour soda) or just plain Coca Cola, with vodka. She would try to hide it from us, but you can't hide the smell of alcohol from a curious kid. She also smoked cigarettes often.

One time when my friend Tanigi and I think Erik Lutchka was over in 6th or 7th grade, and she put on what she called a "seance". She tried to make the candle flame increase. We all thought it was ridiculous, but she was really into it.

Even before that, in 4th grade, I had a step sister at the time, Sandy. One day, while Sandy, Dane and I one day were probably playing with dominoes, building those cascading things, my mom got excited and had us sit with a metal spoon and try to bend it with our minds. For a few minutes I thought wow this would be so cool. But nope, nothing.

Around that same time, a psychic came on some radio station, saying that California was going to break apart into mini islands after this massive earthquake he was predicting. This was in 1994 I remember clearly. We lived in Lakeside, CA, and had this big backyard with a bunch of junk in it, and a sort of shed. We stocked up on all kinds of canned food and water, and practiced what we were going to do in case the world ended. I remember being terrified. I was too young to realize the difference.

I ended up becoming a card magician in high school. I learned all about how to trick people's senses. Quickly after that, I learned how accurate science was, that everything is perfectly rational.

We watched horror movies growing up. All I saw when I was 2 or 3 years old was the Exorcist, Childs Play, Pumpkin Head, and my moms favorite, Brides of Dracula.

My mom was an excellent artist. She drew these amazing masks when she was studying art in college. She was great at decorating. She was a beautiful looking woman. She was also the most loving mother any child could ask for. My brother Dane and I were everything to her, and she made certain that we knew that.

She married quite a few times, and the relationships were always pretty violent.

I got taken to the principles office in 4th grade for wearing an extra large t-shirt from Hot Topic with a picture of Kurt Cobain smoking a cigarette. Makes sense.

I cut out a goatee shape out of construction paper to see what I would look like with one, like Kurt Cobain.

One day, while hanging out with Matt Slaughter, and Maggie and Cindy Pan, and my brother, and Tanigi, Matt let me borrow his skateboard we randomly found at his house. Tanigi already had a board, and so brought it over. That day we all spent trying to ollie, and got it by the end of the day, just barely able to ollie over a broomstick. For the next 4 years or so, we skateboarded every day after school and on the weekends. After we moved in with my Dad, he drove us wherever we wanted to go, all of our friends and everything. He often bought us all food too, and always picked us up and never made us feel bad about what we were doing. He let us do what we wanted to do, he let us make our own decisions.

During this time is when Dane and I started growing apart. I always wanted to good, and he always wanted to be the craziest. He jumped off the highest things, and went the fastest. Eventually he started breaking bones, and we started to hang around people that would get into fights or get into crime. I stopped hanging out with them, and went more into music. Which is around the time I started hanging out with Ty, Randy, and Craig more.

I think my mom committed suicide because she was too scared by what she had found when digging deeper into "the occult arts". She didn't have a scientific education, which was the major part. This meant what she found she did not know how to explain, so there was potential for logical gaps in here thinking. My dad explained, "she would start off with a small logical inconsistency, then expand on that and expand on that, and eventually like it came around a full loop in a clock, what she thought was truth was actually false, it was her mental fabrications".
