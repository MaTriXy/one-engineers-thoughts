```
start creating
eventually create
```

We treat `start creating` as the other, even though they are different. We do this because we experience the "start creating" now, and then if we enjoy that experience, we say "yes I want to start creating". That gets them interested. Whereas "eventually create", they would have to mentally keep track of what they were doing, and then imagine in the future, and _then_ imagine their future self going through that experience. That would be hard.
