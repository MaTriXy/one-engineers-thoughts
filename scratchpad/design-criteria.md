- Are There Universal Aspects in the Structure and Contents of Human Values? 

A value is a (1) belief (2) pertaining to desirable end states or modes of conduct, that (3) transcends specific situations, (4) guides selection or evaluation of behavior, people, and events, and (5) is ordered by importance relative to other values to form a system of value priorities.

- values: as desirable transsituational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or other social entity.

The structure of the typical decision problem considered in this paper consists of a number, say M, of alternatives and a
number, say N, of decision criteria

Design criteria (sometimes called specifications) are a useful thinking and communication tool for the designer. Essentially they list all the things that the product needs to feature to satisfy the user. Design criteria are like the bullet points on the side of a product’s package – a list of the key benefits.

Constraints are a specific type of constraint

Or, criteria are for judging solutions. Constraints are for creating solutions.

Criteria are used to evaluate a product (or solution). A project solves a project, creating a product. A product is a solution.

Design criteria are the explicit goals that a project must achieve in order to be successful.

Design criteria can be divided into primary and secondary criteria. Primary criteria are those that constitute a successful project; the project will be unsuccessful if it does not meet these goals. Secondary criteria are those features that are highly desirable but not absolutely essential. 

Make your design criteria short but as specific as possible. Avoid vague language. List your primary criteria first; then list the secondary criteria.

4.0 Design Criteria

The online shopping system must possess the following features:

Real time transactions of food, books and notes. The system will enable real-time purchases of meals through university ID cards, textbooks and supplies either through ID cards or through the campus network, and purchase and delivery of online course notes through the campus network.
Real-time debiting and crediting of accounts. At the time of purchase, the system will debit the user's account for the amount of the sale and credit the appropriate vendor's account.
Authentication of user and server. The system server will always authenticate both the user to the server and the server to the user.
Data security. All sensitive data must be encrypted before being passed between the client and server; no sensitive data will be sent through the network in clear text.
In addition, the system should, if possible, possess the following additional features:

Compatibility with existing browsers. Users should be able to access the system using any commonly available network browser.
Direct inventory interfaces. The system should be able to interface directly with the various inventory systems of the vendors to allow real-time authentication that the item is in stock and, when the transaction is completed, removal of the item from vendor's current inventory.

"the end state should look like this".


Examples of criteria to use when making decisions about how to balance the budget
include targeting reductions that:
- will have the least negative impact on student learning.
- meet federal and state laws/rules/regulations.
- align with the district’s beliefs, vision, mission.
- are feasible.
- can be implemented by the target date.
- can be implemented with the current resources (people, facilities, equipment,
materials).
- will yield financial savings.
- affect only those items that can be readily reinstated when funding stability returns.
- have the least likelihood of identifiable, adverse long term implications.
