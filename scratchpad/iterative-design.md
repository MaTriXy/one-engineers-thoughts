http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_design

The goal of engineering design is the creation of an artifact. This artifact can
be a physical object, a computer program, or a procedure. The artifact will have a
function, i.e. a particular purpose.

(1) problem definition, (2) conceptual design, (3) detailed design,
and (4) design specification and implementation

During each of these stages,
engineering design decisions are made to progress towards the creation of the artifact.

Formulation of the problem requires the definition of the function of the artifact and
its physical environment. The more general or wider the problem is formulated, the
more solutions are possible and the more diverse the solutions will be. 

The formulation stage must create a least the following statements: a clear
statement of the function of system, the goal of the system, the available budget in
time and resources for design and implementation.

 Involve an inventive step e an invention involves an inventive step if, when
compared with what is already known, it would not be obvious to someone
with a good knowledge and experience of the subject.

ah so one implication of separating the two probs

lance [3:56 PM]
- customer feedback
- grow / beat competition

lance [3:57 PM]
both as fast as possible

lance [3:57 PM]
customer feedback ideally you'd want _now_, during development

lance [3:57 PM]
rather than waiting until after you release something

lance [3:57 PM]
also, it would be good to try as many things as possible

lance [3:58 PM]
like you guys did when you went to new york

lance [3:58 PM]
also, customer feedback is about *quality* like you mentioned

lance [3:58 PM]
so, it's like what if there was a set of customers we had with special privileges that we *marked* for feedback

lance [3:59 PM]
then we spent time during every meeting figuring out exactly what experiments we wanted to run with them

lance [3:59 PM]
maybe 20-50-100 customers, i dunno maybe even just 2 or 3 at first

lance [3:59 PM]
until we'd get a hang of managing their feedback or sumthin

lance [4:00 PM]
so that's all about *feedback*, *experimentation*, and *finding the right thing*

lance [4:00 PM]
as fast as possible

lance [4:00 PM]
then there's the 2nd thing: growth / beating the competition
