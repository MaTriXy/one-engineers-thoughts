A knowledge interface is for problem solving. The problem of understanding. So humans can understand the knowledge. The way to do this, is to solve all the problems or questions that a human will have: what is it's structure, and how did it get here?

So you can drill deep to go into how to recreate this structure, solving every aspect, and teaching you as you go down with visuals. Or you can pan to find similar structures on that plane of complexity in the universe. This would be a standard way to navigate the content.

Then you can quickly navigate everything, and grab it to use in contructing something. The algorithms for navigating are by solving all problems we'll come up with in our head, so it is easy to solve the problems. Then you can focus all of your time finding patterns in this structure essentially!

But that is just adding to the problem set, so it cycles back.

You can have it be `CMD+T` to open the problem space, which you can zoom and pan through until you find what you want, then press `escape` or `enter` to use that thing in your current text editor or graphic environment. So it's like a fast way to navigate the whole universe, to help you build.
