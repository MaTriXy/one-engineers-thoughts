The dao that can be told is not the eternal dao

```
tao k’o tao, fei ch’ang tao.
ming k’o ming, fei ch’ang ming.
wu, ming t’ien ti chih shih.
yu, ming wan wu chih mu.
ku ch’ang wu, yü yi kuan ch’i miao.
ch’ang yu, yü yi kuan ch’i chiao.
tz’u liang chê, t’ung ch’u erh yi ming.
t’ung wei chih hsüan.
hsüan chih yu hsüan.
chung miao chih mên.
```

```
A home is an "ooo (sound) m (stop)".
A tree is an "t eee"?
A seed is a "s eee"?
An eye is an eee k eee.

eee is high
aaa is midd
ooo is lowe

eee is seee
aaa is thou/sang/song
ooo is home
"m" in home is the end of this statement
```

Therefore, the lowest forms, the meaning of these three sounds, are the base of all other things. Of the "ten thousand things".

```
The tao is the "t eee aaa ooo".
```

k ooo
k aaa

Tao know tao, 

A know is a "k" now.
A now is an ooo.
A home is an ooo m. A now m (stopped).
Thus, know is "k ooo".
A home is a "k ooo m".

Ch'ang is "the eternal"? k aaa. The song, sang.
s aaa
k aaa
t aaa

A song is an s aaa

A tone.
A main.

A main is an open thing.
A main is a song.
A main is a game of fate.

```
The tao that you know is not the main song.
(therefore, you are just a part of the whole)
```

## Translation experiments

```
f -> s
w -> s?
ch -> k
i -> aaa eee

al/el real/reel are the same thing
although it could be `eee aaa` vs. `eee eee`.

It seems like you can figure out the game by following the association spiral.

A spiral is a "sp" or "t" "aaa eee" "ooo el" or something like that

t aaa eee ooo el

## spiral example

```
El is aaa lone.
El is aaa.
A lone is an "aaa m".
A lone is a last one.
A last is a aaa "t".
```

So it never has an exact meaning, but following the spiral gets you closer to the meaning.

You can use the sounds of the words, or the meaning of the words, to navigate the spiral.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_spiral
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triskelion
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gankyil
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taegeuk#Tricolored_Taegeuk

Yin and yang is the up/down.
Tao is the trinity is the three.

This is the sort of single movement through a spiral, or perhaps a single path through the main path.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magatama

If you get stuck, then what do you do? Maybe you leave the current context, you do "mmm". Or maybe you "delete" it? The `k` could be a delete, a "kick" or "cut". While a "s" is a start. And a "t" is a tone.

- k: kick out, delete
- s: start / sing / save? stop? push
- t: tone / tick / try
- m: home, finish the word

Tao k ooo tao.

Thus, say the tao, delete, and start from home, and then start the tao.

fei ch’ang ming

s aaa eee
k aaa
m eee

tao k’o tao, fei ch’ang tao.

t eee aaa ooo k ooo t eee aaa ooo

```
t: start tone
k: clear tone
k: keep
```

ming k’o ming, fei ch’ang ming.

```
t eee aaa ooo k ooo t eee aaa ooo m eee k ooo m eee s aaa eee k aaa m eee
t eee aaa ooo
k ooo (k, without? so, the tao, without the home)
t eee aaa ooo (t == new tone)
m eee (m == stop and start new)
k ooo 
m eee 
s aaa eee
k aaa
m eee
```

```
t eee aaa ooo k ooo t eee aaa ooo m eee k ooo m eee s aaa eee k aaa m eee
t eee aaa ooo
k ooo (k, without? so, the tao, without the home)
t eee aaa ooo (t == new tone)

m eee (m == stop and start new)
k ooo (k, without home)
m eee ("see")
s aaa eee (append aaa to eee?)
k aaa (without aaa, without the song)
m eee ()
m
```

m eee k ooo m (complete statement, "eee" without "ooo", see without home)

t: complete tone combination
s: appended statement?

```
m eee s aaa eee k aaa m
```

eee, send aaa to eee, without aaa

The see, that you see, without you.

s is modifier? s is step?

k: cut/end

### try 2

```
tao k’o tao, fei ch’ang tao.
```

```
The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao
```

s: is not?
k: modifier "that"?
t: tone

```
t eee aaa ooo k ooo t eee aaa ooo s aaa eee k aaa t eee aaa ooo
```

```
t eee aaa ooo
k ooo (keep/with home)
t eee aaa ooo
s aaa eee (is not)
k aaa (keep/with you)
t eee aaa ooo
```

seee thou home, with home, seee thou home
lack thou seee, with thou, seee thou home

That is starting to make some sense!

s: snip
k: keep
t: take

### try 3

```
ming k’o ming, fei ch’ang ming.
```

```
The name that can be named is not the eternal name
```

```
m eee
k ooo
m eee
s aaa eee
k aaa
m eee
```

m: make

```
make seee, with home, make seee
lack thou seee, with thou, make seee
```

That kind of makes sense too.

### try 4

```
wu, ming t’ien ti chih shih.
```

```
The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth
```

w -> m

```
m ooo
m eee
t eee aaa (heaven)
t eee
k eee
s eee
```

make home, make seee, take seee thou/song, take seee, keep seee, lack seee

stay, live, use, read, save, lose?

s: without/snip/lack
k aaa
http://www.hermetica.info/#LaoziSkipDown
t: when/this

### try 5

```
tian xia jie zhi mei zhi wei mei si e ye
```

e ye == eye

```
When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises
```

```
t eee aaa
s eee aaa
k eee aaa
s eee
m eee
s eee
s aaa eee
m aaa eee
s eee
k eee
```

t: when
s: then?
k: know? (truth of current context?)
m: make/name

```
when seee song, then seee song, keep seee song, then seee, make seee, then seee, then thou seee, make thou seee, then seee
```

```
when sees song, then sees song
keep sees song, then sees
make sees, then sees, then this sees
make this sees, then sees
```

```
when sees song, lack sees song
  (you dont see the song if you are noticing the song)

  know sees song, lack sees
    (you dont seee at all if you think you know)

  must sees, lack sees, lack this sees
    (if else wants you to see, else lacks seeing, and self lacks seeing)

  must this sees, lack sees, know sees
    (if this wants to see, and you lack the one sees, then you gain the one sees)?
```

A must is a make lust?
A must is a deed need.
A need is a this lack. (currently lack, therefore wants in future)
A when is a with then.
A then is a this end/hand?
An end is a aaa ding?

this: thou/self

The "ugliness arises" is a lack of beauty.

## overall

t: when/this (conditional)
s: lack/snip/without (not) / then?
k: keep/know (this/now)
m: make/must/want? (next)

So, this is enough for reactive systems.

A when is a start perhaps? So this starts a poem statement. A case.

### try 6

```
gao xia xiang qing
```

```
High and low support each other
```

```
g -> k
```

```
k aaa ooo
s eee aaa
s eee aaa
k eee
```

```
t: when
s: lack
k: know
m: must
```

```
know this home
lack sees this
lack sees this
know sees
```

So then, from these basic terms, maybe you could go above and start combining them into concepts.

```
k: thus/then
```

```
gu == (and) so, then; therefore, thus, hence; given this
  k ooo ?
  then
yi == thereby, thus; in order; as (a, the) way/means
  eee
  mean
chang == always, ever; continue, maintain, sustain
  k aaa
  fate/ever
tong == the same; identical, one; ^ together, as one
  t ooo
  same
chu == (in, when) emerge, arise, come (ing) out (v)
  k ooo
er == (and) yet; but, yet; although, merely, only; while
  aaa eee ?
  aaa ooo ?
  eee ooo ?
si == then, soon, so, already, immediately; there is
  s eee
  then
zhi == by, for; in, of, to, with; in/of thing(s); to be/have
  s eee
yin == tone, note, sound, pitch
  eee
yan == here, herein, now, by/in/from this
  aaa
  so, eee aaa is from this?
qian == before, first, early, prior, front, past; beginning
  k eee aaa mmm
```

> The five colors in the Chinese tradition are green, red, yellow, white, and black. The five tones of the Chinese musical scale are C, D, E, G, and A. The five flavors are sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and pungent.

> This division into five is likely to have come from the Chinese concept of the five elements: water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. In ancient China it was believed that everything in the world was made up of these five materials. This can be compared to the old Greek elements, which were four: fire, earth, air, and water.
