Geometric shapes:

- square (4 points of data or something, for directions?)
- circle (pi number)
- triangle (3 steps)

What everything boils down to?

Everybody with tattoo probably felt like they just "had to have one". Maybe this was because it would serve as a permanent record that some people knew already without being able to explain?

Double quotes are for the two fingers, like to show a visual signal "imagine i am saying this".

A string is 1 quote. A string you hold with two fingers, but they come together to a point. So there are two points on the end basically.

```
.Hey this is a string.
```

So but then maybe they tie the strings up on a tree. So those are basically "used strings". So when you use the strings, you hang them up, they become rope?

```
'They this is a string'
```

That is why titles don't have a period perhaps, because they have no end.

Each religion is basically one subpattern of a larger pattern it seems. It is one geometric system instead of another. But they are intimately connected with each other. So they must work together as one. And help each other become great.

But then we can realize perhaps that being separate like this, is what makes us unhappy. I dunno.

```
snow = winter
rain = spring
fire = summer
wood = autumn
```

```
fair = winter (ring around the rosy) (fair the winter)
grow = spring (pockets full of posies)
play = summer (ashes ashes)
fall = autumn (we all fall down)
(ring around the rosy?)
```

```
air = winter
rain = spring
fire = summer
earth = autumn
```

When you are entering stuff down as a researcher, it's much easier to do in these complex symbols. Because this is how _my mind thinks right now_. But in the future, if I or someone else reads it, it is hard to understand. So to them, they need to see it in a standard form. That way they can instantly learn it with ease. Anyone can learn with ease then. So there always needs to be maintained a natural transformation to the standard form. As long as that is true, everything will be fine. Not sure what security implications there will be if man in the middle attacks occur though (yet).

These above seem to just be descriptions of their environment. From their perspective.

> The solar year was composed of ten months of thirty-six days each, and five days sacred to the gods. The lunar year consisted of thirteen months of twenty-eight days each, with one day left over. The solar zodiac at that time consisted often houses of thirty-six degrees each.

> The first six signs of the zodiac of twelve signs were regarded as benevolent, because the sun occupied them while traversing the Northern Hemisphere. The 6,000 years during which, according to the Persians, Ahura-Mazda ruled His universe in harmony and peace, were symbolic of these six signs. The second six were considered malevolent, because while the sun was traveling the Southern Hemisphere it was winter with the Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians. Therefore these six months symbolic of the 6,000 years of misery and suffering caused by the evil genius of the Persians, Ahriman, who sought to overthrow the power of Ahura-Mazda.

> Ahura Mazda (/əˌhʊrəˌmæzdə/;[1]) (also known as Ohrmazd, Ahuramazda, Hourmazd, Hormazd, Harzoo and Hurmuz, Lord or simply as spirit) is the Avestan name for the creator and sole God of Zoroastrianism, the old Iranian religion predating Islam. Ahura Mazda is described as the highest spirit of worship in Zoroastrianism, along with being the first and most frequently invoked spirit in the Yasna. The literal meaning of the word Ahura is "mighty" or "lord" and Mazda is wisdom. Zoroastrianism revolves around three basic tenets – Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds.

thoughts words and Deeds
mind peer and soul

> This retrograde motion is called the precession of the equinoxes. This means that in the course of about 25,920 years, which constitute one Great Solar or Platonic Year, each one of the twelve constellations occupies a position at the vernal equinox for nearly 2,160 years, then gives place to the previous sign.

> Among the ancients the sun was always symbolized by the figure and nature of the constellation through which it passed at the vernal equinox. For nearly the past 2,000 years the sun has crossed the equator at the vernal equinox in the constellation of Pisces (the Two Fishes). For the 2,160 years before that it crossed through the constellation of Aries (the Ram). Prior to that the vernal equinox was in the sign of Taurus (the Bull). It is probable that the form of the bull and the bull's proclivities were assigned to this constellation because the bull was used by the ancients to plow the fields, and the season set aside for plowing and furrowing corresponded to the time at which the sun reached the segment of the heavens named Taurus.

- 10000BC - 8600BC: Leo == Golden age (ruled by sun, after deglaciation)
- 8600BC - 6450BC: Cancer == origin of agriculture (ran out of stuff pretty quickly, so had to start farming to keep up)
- 6450BC - 4300BC: Gemini == band meet (trade begins, self expression, mud hut communities and social games)
- 4300BC - 2150BC: Taurus == first corruption. Bull (fall)
- 2150BC - 1AD: Aries == Ram. Age of war.
- 1AD - now: Pisces == Christian age. fish. Thought. Reason. Logic.
- next: Aquarius == vernal equinox (freedom and technology)

The `fish` is thought.
