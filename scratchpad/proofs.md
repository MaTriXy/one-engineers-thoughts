> A number of philosophers and linguists claim that all definitions of a proposition are too vague to be useful. For them, it is just a misleading concept that should be removed from philosophy and semantics. W.V. Quine maintained that the indeterminacy of translation prevented any meaningful discussion of propositions, and that they should be discarded in favor of sentences.[2] Strawson advocated the use of the term "statement". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition

statement
  A declarative sentence that is either true or false

theorem
  input premises, set rule # antecedent
  output conclusion # or consequent

A theorem transforms a set of antecedents into a consequent. Or more simply, transform a set of facts into a conclusions.

constructive proofs.

constructions transform axioms into theorems

A theorem defines the initial state and the desired state. The proof defines the transformation from the initial to the desired state. In this sense, the theorem says their is a solution to a problem, without showing the solution. The proof shows the solution.

> - Soundness: if the statement is false, no prover, even if it doesn't follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.

> A mathematical theory consists of an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_system

Mathematicians are trying to work out a set of axioms that stand as the foundation for mathematics, but they haven't fully figured it out.

>  We call a theory a set of sentences in a formal language, and model of a theory a structure (e.g. an interpretation) that satisfies the sentences of that theory.

> An interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language.
