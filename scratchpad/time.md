"In the year 1820, a rotation took exactly 24 hours, or 86,400 standard seconds. Since 1820, the mean solar day has increased by about 2.5 milliseconds."

http://www.nasa.gov/topics/solarsystem/features/extra-second.html

912,500 milliseconds in 365 days
900,000 ms in 360 days
875,000 ms in 350 days

1000 years = 900,000,000 ms = 900,000 s = 10.4166666667 days
what = 10 days
10 days = 864,000 seconds = 864,000,000 ms
if we lose 2.5 ms a day

from 1820, to 2012/06/12 (june 12)

in 1820, rotation took 86400 seconds

since between 92 years, it has become 86400.025 sec, or 2,500

86,400,000 = ms per day in 1820
86,402,500 = ms per day in 2012
2012 - 1820 = 192

```
on year 192, gain 2500 ms

I was worried why I was thinking too deeply about.
I got scared a little bit.
Last has lost his mind.

It came in overpowerred.
Holy shit i'm being bombarded.
i couldn't respond in time

Humans only use 10% of brains.

Lucy:

A shape that twists and turns. We try to make sense of it to be simple.

How do you explain time?

Picture a car speeding on a highway.
At a certain speed, speed up that speed to the point where that car disappears.
It goes so fast you can't see it.

Something made me think real hard.

It's really hard to beat yourself at a game that you are really good at.

When I think about things, I find an answer, or I get really tired thinking about the answer.

When I look for an answer, and find something that is perfectly viable, and makes complete sense. I read into it way to much.

Mental stress. Can cause a mental illness.

> The earliest recorded metal employed by humans seems to be gold which can be found free or "native". Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves used during the late Paleolithic period, c. 40,000 BC.[2]

> Silver, copper, tin and meteoric iron can also be found native, allowing a limited amount of metalworking in ancient cultures.[3] Egyptian weapons made from meteoric iron in about 3000 BC were highly prized as "Daggers from Heaven".[4]

> The letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of 'C' to distinguish voiced /ɡ/ from voiceless /k/.

G and K are related.

> The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, who taught around 230 BC. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both /ɡ/ and /k/ before open vowels, had come to express /k/ in all environments.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G

> a voiced velar plosive (/ɡ/ or "hard" ⟨g⟩), as in goose, gargoyle and game;
a voiced palato-alveolar affricate (/dʒ/ or "soft" ⟨g⟩), generally before ⟨i⟩ or ⟨e⟩, as in giant, ginger and geology or
a voiced palato-alveolar sibilant (/ʒ/) in some words of French origin, such as rouge, beige and genre.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel

> Our Sages teach that the gimel symbolizes a rich man running after a poor man, the dalet, to give him charity.
> The word gimel is derived from the word gemul, which in Hebrew means both the giving of reward as well as the giving of punishment.

wwww is rrrr for babies?

> The consonants that babbling infants produce tend to be any of the following : /p, b, t, m, d, n, k, ɡ, s, h, w, j/. The following consonants tend to be infrequently produced during phonological development : /f, v, θ, ð, ʃ, tʃ, dʒ, l, r, ŋ/. The complexity of the sounds that infants produce makes them difficult to categorize, but the above rules tend to hold true regardless of the language to which children are exposed.[9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babbling

> There are two types of babbling. Reduplicated babbling consists of repeated syllables consisting of a consonant and a vowel, such as "da da da da" or "ma ma ma ma",[7] whereas variegated, or non-reduplicated babbling consists of a mix of syllables, such as "ka-da-bu-ba-mi-doy-doy-doy".[8]
