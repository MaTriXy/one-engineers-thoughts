## Metaphors

### Action/observation metaphors

Use metaphors of fire, water, and potentially other things, that we all experience a lot when we're kids, so it has a primal essense. Putting wood on the fire is input for an action to create a bigger fire. When you observe your toe hit the water, you observe a ripple. When you observe ants on climbing a tree, you know there is fruit around (or something). When you observe lightening, you _will_ observe thunder later (maybe with temporal logic). When you observe the fire crackle, you will also observe sparks. When you observe the sunrise, you know it's morning, or it's a new day. When you observe the moon, you know/understand it's night.

When you directly observe a mirror, you observe yourself.

### Transformation metaphors

## Titles

- Logic as Pattern Recognition. All logics can be seen as different forms of pattern recognition. The rules' premises are patterns to be recognized, and the conclusions are what's generated in cognition. So the premise is the external, and the conclusion is the internal.

## Notes

- non-monotonic reasoning makes more sense

## Paper ideas

- Have an intro like "Understanding Formal Methods", where they describe why software community rejected formal methods, yet why they would save so much time.

But "execution" is much better than synthesis/extraction. So an executable modeling language doesn't actually exist!
