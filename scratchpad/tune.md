# A Song is a Mind Walk

There's 3 easy to sound tones in human voice.

- aaa (mouth open)
- eee
- ooo

There's 3 easy to sound kicks with the human tongue.

- "k" (back of mouth, snare drum)
- "t" (open high hat) (two cymbols on drum like clapping together)
- "s" (closed high hat)

So the hunter gatherers started using that info to store information in their head using associative memory.

There might be more going on, but haven't checked.

From these pieces, you can store info in your brain and move around easily between the pieces. You brain in a sense turns into a 3d scrabble board. In this scrabble game, here is the setup:

1. clear your mind. relax, meditate, run, whatever
2. use a "kick" sound to start an associative operation
3. use a "tone" sound to end an associative operation.

That puts your mind into the first state.

Next, you want to make a move. So you make a move in the same way:

1. use a "kick" sound to start an associative operation
2. use a "tone" sound to end an associative operation.

If you are calm and focused, you can do this infinitely, to create a complete picture of your experience. Every sound is tied to an experience, and as you "make a play" in the game, your brain goes to the next state.

From this, you can store _any possible piece of information_. This is how our brain works on autopilot. When you move around, your brain is collecting sensory information from your eyes/ears/nose/mouth/skin/etc. Every moment in time, your brain is in a different state. In a sense, every moment is a _different play in a game_. This is basically what happens inside our brain in our every day lives.

But what the ancient people did was go into dark caves where it is totally silent, and they sat there and _played this game_.

After months of playing this game, you start knowing a lot. You start having a _rich map of associations in your brain_, that you can _navigate at will_. All you have to do to find the piece of information is to _make several plays_ through this associative map.

It seems the ancient hunter gathers did this for 10's if not 100's of thousands of years. But they never wrote anything down (because they didn't have _words_ which we take for granted today). They only have sounds, and associations from sounds. How they did this, I have no idea. But it appears they did.

I came at this from a totally unexpected angle, just trying to dig into a simple programming language. I started basically trying to define words in an associative way (granted, it is definitely different and confusing at first, but it does work). Here's an example, sorta just drilling down and defining words as necessary:

```
A carrying is a moving with.
A carrying is a move with process.
A process is a work flow.
A work is a peer deed.
A deed is a game play.
A game is a risk meet.
A risk is a pick meet.
A pick is a peer move.
A peer move is the base fact. (the only base fact)
```

Then I started noticing some patterns:

```
A sing is a make song.
A song is a tune mesh.
A tune is a note flow.
A mesh is a pure meet.
A pure is a nice meet.
A nice is a good deal.
A deal is a take risk.
A risk is a dark move.
A dark is a gone view.

A sound is a make hear.
A hear is a hit ear.

A there is a not here.
A here is an in side.
A side is a view face.
A face is a self mask.
```

It seems like you could define it only using _4 letter words_.

This got me thinking, could there be a way in the first word of each line to be a sort of an "associative shortcut"? I started trying stuff:

```
A three is a throw "eee".
A throw is a throw "ooo".
A throw is a trow, a true.
A three is a tree.
A three is a true eee.
A one is a... lone.
An alone is an "aaa" lone.
A lone is a ...
An along is an "aaa" long.
A tree is a "t" ring. A "t" sound, then a ring.
A ring is a real thing?
A thing is a ting.
A ting is a tone ding.
A tone is a true wong.
A wong is A one. along.
A tone is a true wong.
A true is a trust "eee"? (comes from e, trust it, since it's an association).
```

In that example, `three` is expanded into `throw eee`. See if you can follow along. A lot of that was just me spilling out whatever my mind thought, which is a good way to find more existing associations.

But then I remembered, hunter gatheres probably didn't have language so they definitely didn't write this down, so the actual _word letters_ are meaningless. Instead, they used just sounds.

So is there a way to just sounds?

That's where the 3 tones and 3 drums/kicks come from. You learn in linguistics that some sounds are _easier_ to make, and others harder. For example, it's harder to say a "u" than an "o".

So then you are left with this:

- aaa (ah sound)
- eee (eee sound)
- ooo (oh sound)
- k ("k" sound, like snare drum)
- t ("t" sound, like open high hat)
- s ("s" sound, like closed high hat)

Then if you try to encode them like that, it turns out you can!

```
A tree is a "t" ring.
eee t eee
A ring is a real thing/ting?
eee eee eee
A ting is a tone ding.
eee ooo eee
```

Anyways, just wanted to share. It seems like it will be useful for solving interesting new problems in a simple way. There's still a lot more to explore, but this at least shows the basics.

The philosopher's stone is hidden in here if you can find it :). You can only find it by actually finding it on your own.
