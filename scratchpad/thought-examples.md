Just now, Sunday May 3, 2015 (9:10pm), Kristina and I got home from the grocery store (trader joes and safeway). On the drive home, she said out of the blue:

"Ok look, a dominoes. Perfect, add that to our pros list."

What I thought was

"Prose? Oh wait, we talked about pros and cons today, about reasons for staying renting our current place."

Then I laughed.

What I _didn't_ do was think deeply about the possibly meaning she could have meant, iterating through all of them. I quickly fetched a problem/solution template, "check if this is related to what we did today", because I felt the word "pro" _sounded familiar_.

That's the kind of stuff natural language processing should be doing.

Also, "prose" came to my mind first because I've been thinking a lot about natural language processing and parsing. But then I realized Kristina wouldn't really say that too, along with thinking about what we did earlier today.

Once I came to the conclusion, maybe a second after I heard "pros", I laughed. I got the running joke.
