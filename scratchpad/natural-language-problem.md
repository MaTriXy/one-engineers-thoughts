definition problem
  The problem of natural language is how to understand it.

You solve problems partially by using a knowledge base. The problem of understanding a word or set of words can be solved by using local and global context, as well as looking up definitions and models of things. You are essentially "painting a picture" of what is being said. Creating a mental model of what is being said. In this sense, it's like activating part of a network. Creating a network on the fly that represents what is being said.

potential partial algorithm
  decode word by orthography, semantics, and phonology
  step learn sound of word
    create mental model of sound of word
      so you can read a word, sound it out, and determine the meaning
  read word, and compare to sound
    This is independent of the actual spelling.
  output is semantic word
  from there, you can create semantic network of meaning, and use that to help constraint interpreting orthography and phonology

  Adams’s (1990) model of reading processing illustrates the interconnection of the orthography, phonology, and morphology of words as they are read. The orthographic (visual),  phonological (sound), meaning, and context processors work together in a parallel fashion to decode words and derive meaning from print. Through feedforward and feedback information, lower-level processes affect and are affected by higher-level processes. (For a complete explanation, see Adams, 1990.). Our second assumption is that automaticity at the sub-lexical and lexical levels is necessary for fluent reading. According to Logan (1988, p. 493), ‘‘automaticity is memory retrieval: performance is automatic when it is based on single step direct-access retrieval of past solutions from memory.’’

  oral language comprehension, vocabulary, alphabet knowledge, phonological awareness, and print knowledge.
  It is critical that helping students students develop phonological awareness so they can move on to decoding words; yet make sense of the reading in kindergarten is not merely decoding words. In both writing and speaking, students learn the conventions of English. Students also have to understand and use academic language to succeed in school. Academic language refers to the language of literacy and books, tests, and formal writing.  Students identify characters, settings, and major events in a story; ask and answer questions about the essential elements of a story; and retell familiar stories. Students use illustrations and context to make predictions, and they identify common types of texts (e.g., storybooks and poems). Students describe the relationship between the illustrations and the story. Both sets of standards ask students to locate the title of the book, use illustrations and context to make predictions, and ask and answer questions about essential elements of the text. it typically takes English-speaking children at least 10 years to become moderately proficient spellers—memorizing about 400 new words per year.
  Moreover, if the student is automatic or is "a skilled reader, multiple tasks are being performed at the same time, such as decoding the words, comprehending the information, relating the information to prior knowledge of the subject matter, making inferences, and evaluating the information's usefulness to a report he or she is writing" (Samuels)

notes
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect
  Comprehension is a "creative, multifaceted process" dependent upon four language skills: phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
  There are specific traits that determine how successfully an individual will comprehend text, including prior knowledge about the subject, well developed language, and the ability to make inferences. Having the skill to monitor comprehension is a factor: "Why is this important?" and "Do I need to read the entire text?" are examples. Lastly, is the ability to be self-correcting to solve comprehension problems as they arise.
  Involves situational and spatial reasoning.
  Most words are learned gradually through a wide variety of environments: television, books, and conversations. Some words are more complex and difficult to learn, such as homonyms, words that have multiple meanings and those with figurative meanings, like idioms, similes, and metaphors.
  Summarize after reading.
  A reciprocal approach provides students with four specific reading strategies that are actively and consciously used to support comprehension: Questioning, Clarifying, Summarizing, and Predicting.
  Proficient readers have well-practiced decoding and comprehension skills which allow them to proceed through texts somewhat automatically until some sort of triggering event alerts them to a comprehension failure (Palincsar & Brown, 1984). Whatever the trigger, proficient readers react to a comprehension breakdown by using a number of strategies in a planned, deliberate manner. These "fix-up" strategies range from simply slowing down the rate of reading or decoding, to re-reading, to consciously summarizing the material.
  Phonological awareness is an important determiner of success in learning to read and spell. For most children, strong readers have strong phonological awareness, and poor readers have poor phonological awareness skills.

This trigger can be anything from an unacceptable accumulation of unknown concepts to an expectation that has not been fulfilled by the text. 

decoding skills
  For each pattern, have a strategy or algorithm to deconstruct it. Forming basically a graph or hierarchy of connections to help you decode it. A decision tree sort of.

reading
  desc Reading is a complex cognitive process of decoding symbols in order to construct or derive meaning.
  Like all language, it is a complex interaction between the text and the reader which is shaped by the reader’s prior knowledge, experiences, attitude, and language community which is culturally and socially situated. (context sensitive)
  There are no concrete laws in reading, but rather allows readers an escape to produce their own products introspectively. This promotes deep exploration of texts during interpretation.
  The main difference between faster and slower readers is that the latter group consistently shows longer average fixation durations, shorter saccades, and more regressions.
  The distance the eye moves in each saccade (or short rapid movement) is between 1 and 20 characters with the average being 7–9 characters. The saccade lasts for 20–40 ms and during this time vision is suppressed so that no new information is acquired.

orthographic learning
  we can identify several key features of a skilled orthographic word-recognition system. First, according to Perfetti (1992), it involves having developed fully specified, rather than partially specified, internal representations. By full specification, Perfetti means that the input code is sufficient to uniquely identify the word to be read, without the necessity for discriminating between several competing partially activated candidates. Because, in these circumstances, the correct word is specified completely by the input code, context does not need to be used to assist in the identification of the word. Ehri (2005) builds on this notion by arguing that the orthographic or “sight word” recognition process is also automatic: it cannot be turned on and off, and is not subject to strategic control.
  any successful model of word recognition will need to have a mechanism for explaining the impact of semantics, both the impact of the semantic context within which the word is processed and the impact of the semantic attributes of the word itself.
  as Share describes it, phonological decoding is the sine qua non of reading acquisition. Share also proposes that the ability to use contextual information to determine exact word pronunciations on the basis of a partial decoding attempt plays an important role in self-teaching.
  orthographic effects in visual word recognition, such as sensitivity or insensitivity to letter order or any other phenomena, are the product of the full linguistic environment of the reader (phonology, morphology and semantic meaning), not just the structure of orthographic letter sequences. only models that are tuned, one way or another, to the full linguistic environment of the reader can offer a viable approach to modeling reading.
  Word features in parafoveal vision influence eye movements during reading.
  Thus, findings with the Roman script reveal that, at least for adult skilled readers, there is early access to the abstract representation of the word’s constituent letters.
  Readers do not fixate every single word in a sentence, but occasionally skip a word. Words are especially likely to be skipped if they are short, highly frequent, and predictable from the preceding sentence context.
  This suggests that, at least during early processing, compound words are processed as a whole.
  the results of the experiments performed as part of this dissertation show that parafoveal pre-processing is, in general, rather shallow, involves only one parafoveal word, and is restricted to the orthographic level.
  - so, you read one word at a time, and use the left and right word to help process.
  The process of  reading is  not limited to  the directly   fixated   (or  foveal) word  but  also  extends to  surrounding (or parafoveal) words,  particularly  the word  to  the right of the  gaze  position. As a major finding,  fixation  times were  consistently lower  if  a semantically  related  word   was   presented   compared  to the  presence  of  an  unrelated   word.
  - so, the next word's high-level meaning is used to interpret the current word. So it's context sensitive, but lookahead.
  higher vocabulary knowledge was associated with faster, more accurate word recognition performance.
  Early analyses of orthographic structure, detectable in bilateral posterior temporal regions within a 150–230 msec time frame, are shown to segment the visual input into linguistic substrings (words and morphemes) that trigger lexical access in left middle temporal locations from 300 msec. These are primarily feedforward processes and are not initially constrained by lexical-level variables. Lexical constraints become significant from 390 msec, in both simple and complex words, with increased processing of pseudowords and pseudo-complex forms.
  at least at some level of processing, complex words are broken down into their morphemes solely on the basis of their orthographic form
  According to interactive activation models [59], visual information continuously cascades throughout the entire orthographic–phonological–lexical–semantic network. This enables partially resolved phonological and lexical–semantic representations (among others) to feed back and provide constraints on other (lower) levels of representation in the network such as orthography.
  A wealth of evidence suggests that phonology and orthography indeed interact.
  Architecture of the bi-modal interactive-activation model (BIAM). A distinction is drawn between sublexical (i.e., smaller than the whole-word) and whole-word orthographic (O-units, Owords) and phonological (P-units, P-words) representations that interact both lexically and sublexically via a central interface (O ó P). Whole-word representations provide access to semantic representations (S-units).
  Rather than memorizing the different visual formats of about 30,000 different words it is more economical to memorize the different visual formats of 26 letters and recognize words via abstract, shape-invariant, letter representations.
  The priming effect obtained with subliminal CAPTCHA primes suggests that shape invariant orthographic representations are being computed automatically and very rapidly.
