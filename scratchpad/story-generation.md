could have like shared experience between multiple agents.

so many agents on ec2 are gaining experience by focusing on a certain thing. this in a sense creates the characters.

then once we have all of these characters with lots of experience, we can understand how their knowledge acquisition evolved, and what they currently know and are capable of. this forms the basis of a story.

so before having a story, you want to make sure the characters have _experience_. To do this, you need to have a model of decision making or memory, if this type of species has a memory.

so this is how you could in a sense create a story for a plant, or a rock. You would first model the rock, then have the rock gain experience. It does this by participating in the world. When it does this, we capture the different state changes that occur in it.

Then with this set of state changes, we can "segment them into events". Using event segmentation theory, segment the state changes of the rock into events.

This means we have a set of events we could use in a story about a rock. A realistic set of events.

Now with that set of events, order them to maximize suspense and interest.

Now we have the model of an interesting story for a rock. This could be automatically generated from a model of the rock, and a model of the processes the rock participates in.

Once you have the model for an interesting story, it must be converted to a document. This means:

- a good title (like BBC titles perhaps)
- clear sections or scenes
- well placed images
- easy to understand text that keeps the reader engaged rather than thinking about the text
- tell the story in a way that it's coming directly from the rocks perspective
