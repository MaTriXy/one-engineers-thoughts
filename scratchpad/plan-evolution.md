One possible plan, building nature website first.

## 0. Study math books

Understand how to build a reactive system using temporal logic. It's easiest to read this stuff while on your way to work at a new place. So, good for starting a job.

- [ ] 2-3 months

Not including, here, all of the math stuff I want to study. Just the math necessary for building a good reactive system.

## 1. Setup dev environment and workflow

- [ ] Maybe 2 weeks full time
- [ ] 1-2 months if working

## 2. Add ability to execute actions in model language

- [ ] 1-2 months if working. So by this time, it would be 6 months working at a company or something. So 6 months to build a reactive system usable in model language.

This requires understanding the action model better perhaps. So need to read this math stuff first. So maybe can work for a company for a few months while I learn the math.

Just basically, study the basic math stuff for a few more weeks or even months, until it makes sense. Build the basic action system in the model language, nothing fancy. So you can execute model code using a nice workflow.

## 3. Build basic static site tool for factsofnature.org

- [ ] Fast if 0-2 are done. Maybe need CSS and HTML model too, ah. That's where it breaks down. I can just build a standard page in CSS and HTML for now. Basically a template that I can plug in model code to. If that, then let's say 2 weeks full time to get all bases covered. So 1-2 months if working.

Make it so I can also use it for developing model language.

Use model language to build the site. Need to also be learning stuff about california, and manually writing the evolutionary plot points at first. But ideally I am writing the plot points using the model language. So I need the basic model language first, which is almost there. Just need to setup the dev environment so it is efficient, and build the ability to execute actions into the model language.

## 3b. Build citation system

- [ ] 1-2 months

So we make sure all facts are good. Be known for high-quality facts. Straight from the research papers. Maybe look into pdf annotation and such, we if there's a quick way to whip together basic pdf annotation, better than mendeley and such. Or maybe there is a faster chrome extension to upload pdfs from urls, then do annotations.

Citation/annotation should link directly to a line or section in a book, so you just click and boom, it takes you right to the source, no complexities.

> So by this point, 8-10 months of working at a company.

## 4. Video

- [ ] Have enough content for google adsense, and good following, maybe 1 year.

1. create plot points in evolutionary history
2. talk about one thing in california landscape (rough draft of story for video)
  - learn california structure
3. create scenes of what was present at each plot point
  - what trees grew then?
  - what animals were around?
  - would you get stung by bees?
  - what was the temperature like?
4. create story and make into a video, describing that scene

So essentially you point out the times in history when key events happened related to that. Don't have to describe how it happened, because that requires more detailed model. Initial model is essentially just plot points.

Then after a while, there will be a lot of plot points. So you can create rich scenes. Just describing the things that existed at that time, and maybe some basic behavior. This is still just describing the observations we can make at that point in time. It doesn't describe how any of it works. So it's still at a low-level of complexity in terms of knowledge. Just describe observations.

Also need to setup social media workflow, so we can build a following on facebook, twitter, and pinterest. Ideally it would be possible to automate this way down the road. Need to think about this more because it will definitely be a growth-strategy type of thing.

Also need citation system setup by this point.

Also, practice voice over techniques.

> _We should be making money by this point._ This means it's about 2 years after working at a company. So basically, I need to work at a company for 2 more years, and then I will be free :). This also means I don't need to buy a raspberry pi or virtual reality anytime soon, or try gardening.

## 4b. Create basic model of social media marketing

Create model in model language of good way of automatically doing tweets. Think about what things are important to people. Ideally, _have a rough model of an intelligent agent by this point_, so you can fine tune it from this point on.

Customer service stuff is needed too. Responding to emails.

## 5. Sketch

We can make these observations richer by creating the illustrations.

1. collect more detailed observations, of colors, sizes, numbers, shape
2. use these detailed observations to create a drawing
  - value types:
    - colors become shades/textures
    - sizes
    - numbers
    - shape
  - drawing is not exact, it is just a sketch at this time, so it would be basically simple sketches of the objects, following principles of b/w drawings
3. maybe create multiple figures
  - with different variations of the object the page is for
  - with short description for the figures
  - some basic text expanding the story with more detail about the drawing
  - no animation yet, since that is a whole other beast technically, just drawing

This is creating basic, non-interactive graphic rendering.

There's a lot of math that goes into this. So will need to research math before this. So ideally, we are making all the money we need to stop working before getting to need drawings. Otherwise, maybe we could float for a few months, while I study the math. However, that would be stressful and hard to concentrate on the math, so maybe I should study the math for this while working at another company. So potentially, study graphics math for like 9 months, and come up with basic graphic model in the next 3. So then I could work for another year, and be ready to leave with a basic graphics system. _So 3 years working at a company by this point._

## 5b. Improve social media marketing techniques

> By this point, I should be able to stop working, with a few months of savings.

## 6. Create pages of internal structures, how it works

Now maybe we can start creating articles for the internal structures. Each article can have several figures that essentially visualizes it's basic model in model code.

At the end of this, we would have a database of basic models. So then internally, we can be writing more robust specifications for these models. And if we are making money, we can start working on the interaction part. The interaction comes after we are making money.

> _We are making more money now._

By this point, I am not working at a company. We can be living anywhere ideally.

## 7. Build the software documentation website

Build a model of most of the current programming languages. Use this to parse all the code on github, and create readable documentation for the code. Summarize all of the basic variables and actions in each programming environment.

So the end of here, we will have more ad sites, and have all of the code in a usable way.

> By this point, we should be making a decent living, fully covering costs, and perhaps a little left over to take trips. Charge for ad-free form.

> Maybe this is 4 years from now.

## 8. Add core features to model language.

Find the gems in that code, and transform it into model language. Stuff for dealing with strings, formatting code, etc. All web-framework and data type of stuff.

Here, also build the rest of the websites, and finish the code for building web apps with model language. Use this to make more money. If it's easy to release a web app, then release a couple.

## 9. Build web crawler

Crawl the web now, and extract important facts to add to the model database. All of the details of the physics simulations. All of the chemical molecules. All animals and genes and everything. Now you have the raw data from which a process of building a model can begin.

If it's good at the time, maybe build a product that is an API for developers to use this raw data directly for a price. Free for open source work. No longer the pain of getting JSON objects of standard objects used in our common knowledge.

> Potential to create a monetizable product.

## 10. Add verification, logical proof to model language.

## 11. Formalization of intelligence

By this point, I want to write the paper. The paper will include high quality sketches, and mostly automatically generated text. And a basic library of models will exist, which we can then start validating, and standardizing. It will be a complete model of intelligence, as tied to the origin of the universe.

It will also show sketches of the history of the universe using beautiful black and white drawings.

## 12. Release Model Language

## 13a. Create tropon org

## 13b. Build a text editor, Source

Source is a information workspace. It allows you to directly see scientific knowledge. You can create or improve scientific models.

## 14. Add an interactive information visualizer in Source

Now that we have sketches, and basic description for the sketches, and basic models for the sketches. We can make the drawings interactive, using pretty realistic models.

By this point, we will need lots of facts in the database. So we can start allowing better search and relationship finding. At least that's the ideal. This isn't necessary for the factsofnature.org website. Just with videos and sketches, it will be a good source of information that we can put ads on.

Be able to see the problem space. Be able to swipe through the history of data and structures.

## 15. Build a raspberry-pi mini cloud

In this stage, 3d printers will be ready to go for the average person probably. So we can then use these models for the internet of thing, so we can start solving the remaining problems in science, and make anything we need.

All people should have free and constant access to the information and 3d printing network.

## 16. Build something with 3d printing or agriculture

So we can automate plant growth or something.
