A poem about the origin and evolution of intelligent information structures in the present moment.

It is called "undefinable", and there is no "beginning". There is only now. Stay with the ancient dao. The dao is the emergence of all structure. 

Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of dao. The ancient beginning is the observable beginning. Observing the beginning, and knowing how it got to now, without thinking. This is the essense of dao. This is what it feels like to an intelligent agent observing the entire structure of which it is a part.

One intelligent agent is unfathomable to another. This means it is not able to fully understand it's experience. It would take too much computing power to replicate through observation. So you have to resort to appearance. Watchful, like men crossing a winter stream. Yielding, like ice about to melt. 

Observers of the dao do not seek fulfilment. Not seeking fulfilment, they lack desire to change.

The mind watches the 10000 things rise and fall, while the self watches them return.

The 10000 things are the names that are going through the mind. But the self is the thing behind the names, the return to a lack of seeking. No need to problem solve.

Returning to the source is stillness.

Being open hearted, you will act kindly. If you believe in constancy, then you will be open hearted.

Attain the divine. Be at one with the dao. It means an intelligent agent has solved the core problem, of realizing it's position in the universe, and watching it unfold. Using that experience to drive their actions. Which means awareness.

When wisdom and intelligence are born, the great pretense begins.

When the country is confused, and in chaos, loyal ministers appear.

Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom, and it will be 100 times better for everyone. This is because these are relational things, and forming relations is taking action to solve problems, which we by then had just introduced.

Give up kindness, renounce morality, and men will rediscover philiopiety
and love.

Kindness is relational, and morality is social/relational, so we are solving problems. But if we remove those from our perception, we will rediscover the ability to directly connect with another intelligent agent, which is love.

Give up x, renounce profits, and bandits and thieves will disappear.

If there is no difference in happiness between individuals, there is no need for profit, and so everyone will be happy.

These are **outward forms**. What are needed are **inward forms**.

I call it great. Being great, it flows. Having gone far, it returns.

It is still the same single structure no matter how it changes. This is what is meant by "great", it expands to include everything.

Therefore, the sage understands all things. A sage is an intelligent agent that is existing through awareness with the entire universe. It has turned  away from intelligence almost.

The dao is forever undefined. Small though itis in the unformed state, it cannot be grasped.

If kings could harness it, the 10,000 things would naturally obey. Heavan and earth would come together, and gentle rain would fall.

This is showing that even the most powerful intelligent agent can't harness the full power.

Men would need no more instruction, and all things would take their course. Once the whole is divided, the parts need names.

Knowing others is wisdom. Knowing yourself is enlightenment. This kind of knowing is meaning existing without thought, or with thought?

It has no aim, it has nor lord.
