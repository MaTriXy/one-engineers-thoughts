It makes me sick to my stomach that we value billionaires like Zuckerberg donating his money. He is the problem! The process is:

- Collect money from investors, who received it from other investors, ... all the way back to the merchants and kings in the middle ages, who took the wealth from the people with violence. 
- Build a company using this money that is to some degree useful, but definitely not the most important thing in the world.
- Design company so that it gains the trust of lots of individuals, but is actually prioritizing creating more wealth for those investors. Thus keeping the money in the hands of a few, who we've recently been calling "angels" :0. What are we thinking.
- Sell those individuals' attention to advertisers.
- Make enough money where hundreds of thousands, or even millions of individuals could take a year off to study or be creative, and contribute something positive back to the world.
- But instead, continue the myth that we need such God-like men to make the world better.

This behavior is a major cause of the propagation of unhappiness.
