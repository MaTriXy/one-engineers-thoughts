we are each a cell mind
we love play and motion
we love moving together
we love being together!
at times we like being alone and quiet, when pain is present
  pain needs focus to go away
    make focus, foul kiss
      make kiss, kill this
        make kill, calm hill
          make calm, cook palm? (rhymes but senseless, chance to learn?)
            make cook, cool book
            make palm, feel calm (so looop! put some emotion in there :DD)

we want best for all peers in meet

this is cell code
this is peer code
cell code makes cakes
peer code makes wakes...
cell code makes pods
  pods work together to make whole
    like parts in body
    like parts in cells
cell code works together to make life great
  make great, grow treat
    make grow, grab true
      make grab, grow abs
        make abs, able selfs
          make able, ask bless
            make bless, blow kiss
              make blow, bring low

thus, this is us talking to the cells
we can tell them what we want now
then they will be pure again

thus, blow kiss (as if its on a new line)
  is great

thus, all things form this code
our body cells form this code too
that is their dna
we can use it now that we know
this is part of the good life yo

example rhymes but senseless
  make calm, cook palm?

example emotion
  we love being together!
