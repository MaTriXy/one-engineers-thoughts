Farming technology first introduced to the region during the First Temperate Neolithic was developed further by the Vinča culture, fuelling a population boom and producing some of the largest settlements in prehistoric Europe.

They were only superior because they had to develop technology because of changing environment.

Most people in Vinča settlements would have been occupied with the provision of food. They practised a mixed subsistence economy where agriculture, animal husbandry and hunting and foraging all contributed to the diet of the growing Vinča population.

> Vinča agriculture introduced common wheat, oat and flax to temperate Europe, and made greater use of barley than the cultures of the FTN. These innovations increased crop yields and allowed the manufacture of clothes made from plant textiles as well as animal products (i.e. leather and wool). 

Making more food led to making clothes! From excess time.

A chiefdom is thus led by a highly ranked incumbent of an inherited political role, chief: chiefs lead because of their ascribed status, not their achieved status.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiefdom

Chiefdoms are characterized by centralization of authority and pervasive inequality.

At least two inherited social classes (elite and commoner) are present.

Chiefdom creates inequality: elite, commoner.

A single lineage/family of the elite class becomes the ruling elite of the chiefdom, with the greatest influence, power, and prestige. Kinship is typically an organizing principle, while marriage, age, and sex can affect one's social status and role.

chiefdoms are unstable. They are prone to cycles of collapse and renewal,

> Anthropologists and archaeologists have demonstrated through research that chiefdoms are a relatively unstable form of social organization. They are prone to cycles of collapse and renewal, in which tribal units band together, expand in power, fragment through some form of social stress, and band together again. An example of this kind of social organization were the Germanic Peoples who conquered the western Roman Empire in the 5th century CE. Although commonly referred to as tribes, anthropologists classified their society as chiefdoms.

> In Southeast Asian history up to the early 19th century, the metaphysical view of the cosmos called the mandala (i.e., circle) is used to describe a Southeast Asian political model, which in turn describes the diffuse patterns of political power distributed among Mueang (principalities) where circles of influence were more important than central power. The concept counteracts modern tendencies to look for unified political power like that of the large European kingdoms and nation states, which were an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century advances in map-making technologies.

europian kingdoms was an accidental by product of map making technology.

> Nikolay Kradin has demonstrated that an alternative to the state seems to be represented by the supercomplex chiefdoms created by some nomads of Eurasia. The number of structural levels within such chiefdoms appears to be equal, or even to exceed those within the average state, but they have a different type of political organization and political leadership. Such types of political entities do not appear to have been created by the agriculturists (e.g., Kradin 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004).

> Family is a group of people affiliated by consanguinity (by recognized birth), affinity (by marriage), or co-residence/shared consumption (see Nurture kinship).

> A lineage is a unilineal descent group that can demonstrate their common descent from a known apical ancestor.

> The definition of marriage varies according to different cultures, but it is principally an institution in which interpersonal relationships, usually intimate and sexual, are acknowledged. A broad definition of marriage includes those that are monogamous, polygamous, same-sex and temporary.

> Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill, regarding the ability of an individual or organization to "lead" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations

Somehow, leadership goes wrong. The wrong things want to be done.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership

> a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task.

But definition shouldn't be focused on self, but on whole. The whole intelligence should be guided in a beneficial direction. In a positive direction.

So leadership is directly about solving problems. The probl arises when it's not clear which problems to solve.

Leadership: How effective you can be in a situation.

effective: how much effect can you create?

> In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.

Fantastic early attempt at making it easy to navigate over the history of the universe :D http://histography.io/ 

The events in the timeline are problems that we have solved. So you can always look over past solutions to see which problems were solved, and it gets automatically recorded in history.

In the other screen, the events (actions at a time) would be switched to problems, and their structure. So you can see how problems breakdown, and what their subproblems are. Basically, what is your problem map.

So then you can go back through time to see how the problem evolved in structure, and who contributed to it evolving. The spiral. Or maybe it's like you're drilling down into specific subproblems instead of the spiral. Depending on where the mouse is, it zooms into problems related to that space. So this would mean the most high-level abstraction would be the end, and the most low-level problems would be at the other part. Or since problems form a graph, it would be like we are exploring a graph in that sort of way. Maybe it's like sorta navigating a certain map in a brain.
