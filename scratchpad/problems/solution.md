## Solution

Is a solution a set of tasks? Each task then can be a problem itself ("how to do you do x?"). So you get down to the micro-tasks.

So then a solution to a problem is a set of tasks.

Then you have _implementing_ those solutions, or _doing_ the tasks. Once the tasks are done, or solutions implemented, you can test, evaluate, and then release your solution. Or if the tasks is just completable, it can be verified, and then the final result given to whoever needs it.

A mathematical equation is a "solution", in the sense that it transforms some value into a different value. Any solution is a function that transforms current state into desired state. This _should_ mean that you can describe any mathematical equation as a set of steps/tasks/actions. "move x to the left side; divide by y; get the result".

A problem can have a set of solutions, all with pros and cons. They're called _alternatives_.

A problem can have partial solutions. These are just "some of the things you need to do" to solve the problem. So, they are tasks, but not _all_ of the tasks necessary.

If solutions are like hypotheses, then they need to have _predictions_:

- how long do you think the task will take?
- what does the end result look like? (sketchfile)
- what are potential problems you will run into.
- probably others

A solution is a transformation function. A function is an algorithm. An algorithm is a set of instructions. Therefore, a solution is an algorithm. A solution is a set of instructions (or "tasks").

Solutions are action words. You first want to understand the nouns, the way things _are_ in this ideal world. Solutions describe the how, not the what.

Not "install library", then "track events", but "I have a library installed", and "I am receiving events".

"Get your job done" isn't correct, because a "job" is a task, so it's basically saying "Solve your problem", but using a specific solution.

"Understanding a job" is confusing because it's like saying "Understanding a solution", but that is not true, you really want to be "Understanding a problem".

Fitness: solving situational needs. A "situational need" is a problem within a situation.

"Do this job" means "solve this problem", but it's more confusing. It's like saying "Do this solution", which you don't want to say.
