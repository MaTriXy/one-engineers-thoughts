One common problem that people have is a lack of money. The desire for more money means there is a difference between the current state and desired state.

This problem has several solutions. Some of them include:

- working for money
- stealing money

Some common solutions include:

- selling the product
- growing the product

This opens up new questions. That is, it creates new problems that need to be solved. Some of them include:

- getting customers
