Where product management fails
Here is a story of a factory worker and his manager. It hopes to show where product management reasoning breaks down, by showing in story form how the following 4 fallacies show up in practice.

1. You’ve never encountered the problem yourself. The one time the team tried to show you, it couldn't be reproduced. You left thinking they probably are over exaggerating.
2. You’ve done the mental math and concluded the problem only costs a few minutes a day. You tried to understand the problem your teams describe, but your immediate reaction is that can't be that big of a problem. This happens when you can do some quick mental math and conclude the team is still able to work efficiently; therefore, it's not that much of a problem.
3. Your team was able to show you the problem one time, but it was an easy fix. One of your team members brought a problem they always complain about to you. This time you decide to actually dig into it with them, ”fine, let’s see”. It turns out to be an easy solution. You conclude again that it must not be a problem, they must be over thinking things.
4. You think your team is not explaining things clearly enough. Your team still complains about the problem, and given (1) and (2), you don't see how it's a problem. So you decide to try one more thing, having them clearly define and outline the problem. Document it. Then, it seems, you will be able to understand the problem. But the team has provided several thorough documents analyzing the problem in the past, and it has never had an effect.

These are 4 common fallacies of reasoning. Next is a story to outline this situation.
# The manager and his teams “workflow problems”

## Part 1
Imagine we are building cars in a big car factory. And the team on the factory floor are constantly complaining about how the machines they use to screw in bolts always break down or run at half power. So we consistently have to break out of our flow and manually tighten the bolts, or debug why the machine isn't tightening the bolts. We learn to trust that the machine won't do it's job correctly, so we start double checking all of the machines work.

The manager notices things take a lot longer than he expects. He asks "why is this stuff taking so long?" And the team on the factory floor knows exactly why. Because you can't count on the machines. You have to double check everything the machine does. But they have said that before to no effect, so they just stay quiet.

The manager says "let me see". So one day he goes down to the factory floor and stands next to a worker for 10 minutes, watching the machine. "I don't see anything wrong with the machine", he says. You, the factory floor worker, say "no, really, this always happens, you just must have come at the wrong time".

So the manager leaves thinking it's not that big of a deal, and nothing changes.

## Part 2
The factory floor workers keep complaining. "We can't count on the machines, they always make mistakes and we have to manually spend all this extra time making up for their mistakes."

Getting a little frustrated, the manager comes down for a second look, this time for a good 20 minutes. "Aha! There it is" the factory worker says. "See, the machine didn't tighten that bolt, so we have to tighten it manually now." The manager calculates in his head "it takes an extra 30 seconds to tighten these bolts, and this probably only happens let's say 5 times a day, so that's only 2-3 minutes per day. Not a big deal." The manager tells the factory worker, "yeah, but you can just tighten it, it's not that big of a deal".

The manager leaves, and nothing is done.

## Part 3
The worker, now starting to get very frustrated that their workflow problems are getting ignored. They are determined to get the manager to understand the problem this time. So they write up a document, outlining the problem in detail. Keeping track of every time the machine breaks, for days and weeks on end. Well, he at least hopes to. But he can't devote 100% of his time to documenting the problems with the machines, because he won't be able to do his regular work. So instead, he at least thinks he has captured 2 or 3 good examples of why the machines are hampering their productivity. The worker has a "case" to present to the manager.

So the worker presents the case to the manager. A 5 page document with photographs and tables and metrics. An hour meeting. The manager takes a quick glance over it and says, "I still don't see how this is that big of a problem, why can't we just deal with the 2-3 minutes a day of having to account for the machines errors, it's not that bad."

At this point the factory worker is pretty angry. The manager is not listening, in the deepest sense of the word. He has already made mental calculations and decided long ago that they are overreacting and it's not that big of a problem. He even sat down twice with his team, and saw "first hand".

In the end, nothing is done. The factory workers still have to deal with the frustrating conditions. As time goes on, they grow more and more tired of having to put in such extra effort to account for the machine errors, while also told to move faster by management.

They can't move faster! The machines are broken! Management needs to not fall prey to these 4 problems of reasoning:

1. If we can't reproduce the problem right when you are looking, it doesn't mean it's not a problem.
2. Without experiencing the problem first hand over several days or weeks, mental calculations are not accurate. Concluding it's a "small problem" that is low priority is inaccurate.
3. If the one time you do see the problem, it is a quick fix, that is not a good enough sample to accurately diagnose the problem as low priority.
4. Writing docs doesn't help, because of 1-3: your mind has already concluded the problem is low-priority. You have done mental calculations, and seen one or two examples. This isn't enough.

## Final notes
The biggest reason for this story is to hopefully get across the point that, your team is very unhappy with the working conditions. And our complaints have been ignored for over a year. It wears away at our self esteem and our patience. We know we are capable of much better work, and want to work in an environment where we can push ourselves to new levels, not be kept in an endless cycle of making up for the errors of the machines, asked by the manager “why are things going so slow?” only to be ignored. We know exactly why things are going slow, and exactly how to fix them.
