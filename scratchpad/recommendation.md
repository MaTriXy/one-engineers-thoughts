Hey dude, sorry I never got to say goodbye to you man! I loved working with you. Good memories of all those long whiteboard sessions where we mapped shit out in insane detail, and our walks to the coffee shop and chatting about life and ideas.

How's everything going for you still? Hope we get to connect again soon :)

I'm writing to ask if you'd be willing to write a LinkedIn recommendation for me that highlights my ability to think through and solve problems with you. I feel like we worked really well together.

Ideally, I'd love for you to outline the experience you had with me while mapping out and building Deku, as we were trying to figure out quick but good enough solutions in the app to keep us iterating quickly, and often digging into the architecture decisions, optimization problems, researching type theory / functional programming / math, etc.. I'm working on applying to some game companies (!), and they value being able to think about things at a foundational level, to be able to solve novel problems and create best-in-class solutions for high-performance and scalability.

I imagine you're super busy as usual with Segment now, but I would be so grateful if you managed to put together some words for me.

Cheers!
