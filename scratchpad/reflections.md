# Summary

## Current State

- i jot down small problems
- i start massive documents to fix problems
- i don't break it into small increments
  - because in these cases i know how to get to the end state already, and breaking it into small increments would just make it take longer
    - doesn't take into account the resources we have available
    - doesn't take into account the effects of small improvements across the team
- i don't want to spend the time in meetings
  - because i think they won't understand
    - because i don't want to spend the time writing the document
      - because i want the problem fixed right now
      - because i already know the solution
      - because sometimes the partial solution means we can move onto another project, but really the partial solution leaves the main problem still in place, and i don’t want to keep waiting.
      - doesn’t take into account limited resources
        - but at the same time, i feel like meetings take up limited resources, so it seems like we’d be more efficient in this case to skip them
- i think most group meetings are ineffective
  - because they break me out of the zone
  - because we are much more absorbed in the problem when we are actually solving it / experimenting, than thinking about it in a meeting
    - so to really map out the problem, direct experimenting is better than meetings
- when i don't want to spend the effort documenting the problem
  - i know how to solve it already
    - why can't i just solve it?
      - because we don't have enough resources
        - so i need to be more aware of the resources
  - because it is faster for me to solve it than to communicate it
    - even if it takes 2 weeks, it feels like. for a 2 week project, to communicate it would require several days of documenting, then a few meetings, and it seems like it would take much longer than 2 weeks by then. so i feel like i would be faster.
- at some point i give up and just want it to be solved already; it's too much work to document a large project
  - i get frustrated and try telling people about the frustration, as a last resort
- i give group feedback in public
  - i reason that i am being transparent
  - it is ineffective because it is confrontational
- i worry about people complaining about the solutions i create, so i often don't create them until they are well thought out in my head
  - but i don't want to spend the time explaining them, i just want to get to the future.

## Desired State

- making a note of the situation isn't enough
- mapping out the problem space is too much, it will take forever and result in nothing
- do something in between, that takes into account the resources, time, and other projects we have to do.
  - rejection: to me this feels like we're never going to get to the end solution
    - this rejection still ignores the fact that we have limited resources
- don't desire an instant solution
  - rejection: but if i already know a great solution, why should i not desire that?
    - ignores limited resources and that we have several other projects
- spend time in the meetings
  - rejection: this requires a lot of preparation, and to me it doesn't feel justified because of above (2 week project would take a lot of planning, turning into more than two weeks, and much more work on my part)
    - doesn’t take into account the benefit it may have on the others in the meeting
- it’s worth getting more input to see if there’s lower hanging fruit
  - agree: get better solutions with other input
  - rejection: low-hanging fruit doesn't solve the main problem often, and i feel a strong desire to want the main problem solved.
    - told i am not accurately representing reality, that it actually does solve the core problem
      - this is where i get frustrated, “but i have experience with this, are you saying i am misinterpreting experience?”
- have patience to iterate through solutions
  - makes sense when you don't know the solution, but desire a solution
  - rejection: when you already see what the world could be like, and how to get there, and have even solved this problem many times before, it is frustrating that you have to do it in small steps and have it take much longer.
    - it is also frustrating when others say that i need to get feedback and iterate, because i have already went through that process of iterating and getting feedback when i solved it the other times in the past. the person saying this may not have solved it before, and often the person saying this is in a more powerful company position, so it’s implied that I accept their advice as more correct than my own.
- it's not all or nothing
  - all or nothing approach will always end with nothing
- feedback is best given in a private environment

So it seems the problem is, how do I not get frustrated that we aren't at the future state right now. I need to think of ways to deal with the current state. Why do I need to only make incremental improvements when I already know how to make substantial improvements? That's my main problem. But something is wrong about the phrasing, it still thinks my perspective is the right perspective.

## Key Takeaways?

Focus on limited resources and small improvements.
Be aware of large improvements and potential futures, but do not desire them.
Desire large improvements and you will be frustrated and disappointed.
Be aware but do not desire.
Accept the current state completely.
Accept limited resources, seek small improvements.
When you experience frustration while working, take note.
But remember that resources are limited, many projects compete for attention.
Find the pattern in your frustrations, and write it down. Identify the core problem.
Do not create heated arguments when speaking with others.
Be direct and honest, but not harsh.
Have your intentions be pure.
Address one aspect of this problem with a small project.
Present only one small project. More than one will confuse others.
Be brief, yet thorough.
Remember, many projects compete for attention.
Notice the ideal, but do not desire it.


- take into account that we have limited resources
- take into account that the company is working on many projects that are competing for resources
- somehow be patient with this process, that we can’t solve my problem right now. not sure how to do this one. i just try to suck it up and not say anything, but that results in frustration and sometimes anger.
  - direct this energy to documenting the problem, and finding a short term solution maybe?
  - take into account that we have limited resources
  - look for positive effects that small solutions can have
    - don’t feel frustrated that these small effects are much smaller than the larger solution’s effect
      - you are improving the process, even if it is small
      - get rid of desire to make big improvements?
