You could literally have a "chip" or "seed" that could unfold into a personal shell for you, an exoskeleton.

It would harvest energy from the sun, and collect material from the environment, to create some sort of "standard chemical laboratory" locally. Or even these things could be centrally located and sent through drone channels.

(note, the words I like best are 1 or 2 syllable, so maybe there is some pattern mentally that goes along with those numbers, or even a fading away with the occasional 3 syllable, etc. Is there any pattern?)

Once you have a local chemical laboratory, the question is how to synthesize DNA and proteins, the "raw materials" for a cell.

Once you have cells, you can then quickly grow carbon chains, or some sort of "food". Maybe there is also a way to prepare this food so it is interesting and tasty.

That would take care of eating.

Then with water, you can drink...

graphene is monolayer material

> The supreme characteristics drawn are
the highest mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conduction

> In this study we concentrate on the Graphene field effect transistor GFET. The main features
of the GFET are its ability to operate at room temperature, its size of one atom by 10 atoms
wide, its extreme sensitivity and the ability to operate with the application of very low
voltages. Such properties give the graphene transistor to be a successor of SiMOSFET in
VLSI technology

> Graphene FETs are generally fabricated by the epitaxial graphene synthesis grown on the SiC
base material. Metal paths are deposited to serve as drain and source. Graphene can be
monolayer (MLG) or bilayer (BLG) and can be doped by boron nitride (BN). A layer of graphene on which a dielectric material is deposited is grown on a substrate by the
ALD (atomic layer deposition) technique. Boron nitride is introduced on both surfaces of the
graphene layer and then led to a bilayer of graphene (BLG). The transistors can be long channel to nanotransistors of less than 10 nm gate length.

> IBM Research still hasnâ€™t found a way of giving graphene the all-important bandgap that is required for the fabrication of digital logic, and thus graphene-based computer processors. For next-gen processors, IBM seems to be focused on carbon nanotubes, which can have a band gap, over graphene.
