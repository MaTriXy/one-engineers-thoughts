Carbon, number 6. Life is built with carbon. It is the most effective way to build things. Carbon crystal structures.

4th most abundant by mass in universe, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen. (1, 2, 8 _3_).

+4 is most common form of carbon.

The way carbons combine is potentially the way the 6-s combine with other games? Pretty much.

> Isotopes of carbon are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus a number of neutrons (varying from 2 to 16)

> The isotope carbon-12 (12C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while carbon-13 (13C) forms the remaining 1.07%.

12 and 13 in carbon.

> Carbon-13 (13C) is a natural, stable isotope of carbon with a nucleus containing 6 protons and 7 neutrons.

> Carbon-13 has a non-zero spin quantum number of 1/2, and hence allows the structure of carbon-containing substances to be investigated using Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance.

> The concept of mental health in China is influenced by Confucian ideology as well as an emphasis on family. The Chinese emphasize "highly personal duties and social goals" rather than the individual, and personal rights. Because of this, those suffering from mental illness are considered as bringing shame on the entire family. For this reason, mental illness is rarely discussed

> Whatever the problem, it commonly came down to the fact that they could not communicate by speech or writing in a way that fitted in with the school curriculum.

> The idea is to split each tile of the heptagrid into seven triangles whose
vertices are the centre of the tile and the end-points of its edges. Then, we
split the triangles into four triangles by taking the mid-points of the previous
triangles: the new triangles are defined by a vertex of the previous triangles and
the mid-points of the edges of the previous triangle which meet at the vertex.
This defines generation 1 and generation 2 of the process, see Figure 4. W

> A coordinate is defined by four numbers in the format (σ, ν, τ, π): σ is the number of the sector in which the triangle lies; ν is the number of the heptagon of the sector in which the triangle lies; τ is the number in [1..7] of the generation 1 triangle in which the triangle lies; and in this triangle, π is the number of the triangle itself. Later on, τ will be called the slice and π will be called the place. Note that the central heptagon has the coordinate (0, 0) as it belongs to no sector.

1. sigma: sector index where triangle is. `triangle sector index`
2. v: heptagon index of triangle sector: `triangle sector heptagon index`
3. tau: number 1..7 of generation(1) triangle
4. pi: the number of the triangle itself

tau: slice of pi
pi: place

Central heptagon has coordinate 0, 0, since it belongs to no sector.

> For the other heptagons, side 1 is shared by the father of the
heptagon in the tree. Note that we consider that the father of the root of the
tree is the central cell.

> the father of the root of the tree is the central cell.

You are an element in the heptagrid. Find your way back to the center.

> In each 1-triangle, we have four triangles of generation 2, we call them 2-
triangles. The four 2-triangles of a 1-triangle are numbered from 0 to 3. First, we number the vertices of a 1-triangle T from 0 to 2: 2 is the centre of the heptagon, 0 and 1 are the vertices of the side of the heptagon defining T . Following the counter-clockwise orientation, 0 comes before 1.
