My blog where I run experiments and overanalyze things.

I have been told all my life that I overanalyze things. My dad at thanksgiving dinner in 2015 even told me that I am totally lost and hopeless, that I need to stop thinking so much and get a normal job, relax a little. My mom committed suicide when I was 15, and my younger brother was 13. For some reason this keeps me going, to try to simplify knowledge so I can understand everything, and everyone else can too. It's possible to understand everything, and for it to be easy to understand. With this knowledge, we can do or be anything, and be permanently happy: able to learn to solve any problem we want. We will no longer have to work on things we don't want to. We will be able to be all that we can imagine. In the process, we will help all other individuals experience their form of happiness.

This will mean people can communicate better, and be happy. We can do what needs to be done, and nothing more or less. We live as we want to, while helping others do the same.

If the gain of information comes at the loss of other information, then it isn't ideal. Gain in one area comes at a loss in another. This is where pain and suffering come in. We gain consciousness of our experience, which permanently effects the world, while our body dies and goes away.
