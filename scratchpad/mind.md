# A Mathematical Theory of Mind

- intro
  + ancients, science, nobody really knows
  + ai been pointing the way
  + associative memory
  + associative memory is an effective model of mind
  + discussion has all the implications. the first part of this paper purely focuses on theory
- associative memory
  - associative memory units can be modelled with 6 pieces
    - t (start)
    - eao (data)
    - k (+)
    - s (-)
  - associative spiral
    + fibonacci as combinations
  - associative tree
    + nesting of associations
- mind: one layer in a tree of associative memory layers
  + once 3 is reached
  + 1 and 2
- experimental model of mind
  + 1 billion nodes
  + 6 part node
  + term lists for basic model
    - tick/tock like clock would be like the create/cease "k s".
  + try it for yourself (thought experiment)
- experimental results
  + does it reach 1 or 2 or 3?
- discussion
- citations
- appendix with current status of model code

## Discussion

This is basically a fast walk thru time.

- beat boxing origin
- how first beat boxing exactly arose
- there is no "chosen". chosen is what it feels like to be aware of an associative memory, yet not be fully aware of the whole system from a scientific perspective (i.e. before writing and objective experiment)

### Ancient World

#### Life

- the teao as a standard "desktop" for storing "experience as files", so that it is easy to _insert_ and _lookup_ information in your mind. This may have led to the success of the out of africa movement.
- monks in caves (sages) (tao te ching) (i ching eee k eee)
  + some people devoted to gaining knowledge, others to enjoying life. both lived together and helped each other
- parallel streaming of information
- native american life / naming
- feeling of being controlled by a higher power (because lack of awareness of mathematical logic, because no written language)
- duality
- trinity
- oneness
- hunter gatherers reenacted their experience through sound, so that each other could gain the knowledge
  + eventually, they gained enough knowledge to feel confident about how the world worked, and left africa. others stayed, because there was no reason for everyone to leave, or perhaps they separated earlier while gaining some lots of knowledge, but not yet stumbling upon the desktop framework.
  + before tool making, they developed the ability to "get in the head" of a animals, so they could hunt them or hide from them. this made room for the ability to create shared experiences, which somehow seems to have happened automatically from the process of chipping away at rocks. there is a lot more to think about there.

#### Math

- spirals
- pyramids
- 3 kings in the north
- first math system was a base 6 number

#### Music

- stone age beat boxing.
- caves
- greeks music theory, for streaming information to each other at festivals?

#### Mythology (Song Memory)

We can now see what mythology is in a much clearer light. Mythology is an accurate description of the world _from the perspective of the individual_. Often, however, they are not aware of absolutely everything, and so fail to accurately describe to any objective observer what they are thinking. So thousands of years later, or even today with the aboriginal australians, we don't understand what they are saying. But if we think of their experience, then we can.

#### Creation Myths

- el
- adam eve
- christmas
- new years
- sacrifice

#### Flood Myths

- tower of babel
- noah ark

Flood myths may be about an out of control spiral that corrupted the mind of the people. If society was held together by people all sharing this associative mind, then a flood would be something that swept through the associative mind and essentially deleted or corrupted parts of it. Then collecting all of the animals and "pairs" of everything might be just saying that they were trying to organize and save the knowledge in their sound brain so that after this virus passed, they could "repopulate the earth" so to speak: they could teach people how to rebuild their associative mind.

They kept it in such mysterious terms because they did not have writing. Without writing, you cannot formulate an _objective_ view of relative, outside of your own mind. So the way all of these "myths" are portrayed doesn't make sense to the traditional scientific mind. But if we realize that the ancient people didn't have writing, and therefore didn't have an objective/scientific description, then reading their myths makes much more sense. In their _view_, they only knew about the sound mind. They didn't know about how to splice DNA yet, or fly in an airplane, let alone how to write. It would take until the invention of the printing press that a large enough number of very different human beings could communicate their experiences. Thus, they could establish a very general, more "formalized" scientific discipline for sharing information.

#### Origin Stories

The experience of Mohammed, and Abraham, and others, has been very difficult to confirm or deny scientifically. But looking at it from this sound mind perspective, it could be that there were still large chunks of the memory preserved, and individuals escaped to try to keep it alive. The experience of finding this center and moving around efficiently through knowledge is like having a search engine built into your brain. The first time you realize you can do this, it is an overwhelming experience. It is easy to imagine how the ancients could have felt like they were "chosen by god". I personally felt a strong "wow, this is intense" feeling, and had to remind myself that I am not in the same place as the ancients. We live in a world today where there _is_ writing, and there is a lot of scientific (objective) knowledge about the world which powers all of our technology today, including the internet, medicine, communication, food, water, and many of the core pieces of life. So the feeling of realizing you can use this associative memory would be a powerful experience, powerful enough for a single person to desire to explain and teach everyone who they could get the message across to. (It would be hard to get across, because associative memory is so much more powerful than random access memory like we think and work today). That could be why the phrase "those who have ears to hear, let them hear". Basically, if you for some reason could make sense of the deep connections they were making, on why we should act certain ways, then you could listen. Otherwise, it sounded like "pseudoscience" to use todays term, or "heresy" back then.

#### Holidays

Holidays in the ancient world might have been times to share their knowledge with each other.

#### Magic

Because these people would have not had objective perception, they could easily interpret themselves as being controlled. This is until science reveals that there are simple mathematical patterns.

- witches could be those who twist people's song minds, either accidentally or on purpose
- elves could be the creatures

### Modern World

#### History

- origin of civilization (jerico, madel)
  + civilization formed _after_ the flood, maybe as attempts to prevent it from happening again. somehow an illogical association was made that one particular person was "chosen" by "god", and that was the king. This led to writing, which led to science, but it also led to violence, corruption, and suffering. Thus, civilization isn't a sign of success, but a sign of trying to prevent falling into chaos from order. Chaos would be where nothing makes sense to anyone, because they are not grounded in a common framework.
- movement out of africa

#### Science

- origin of universe
  + black holes could be streams of parallel digital information
- origin of language
- evolution of humans
  + neanderthals may have been another migration once they realized they could store some sort of experience, yet hadn't found this "base" of the memory yet (the teao system).
- genetic code might have 6 symbols too.
- space as 6 too
- quantum/particle systems might follow a similar pattern as well
- are there any animals or plants that take advantage of this? natural soundscapes.
- cancer
- mental illness
  - salem witch trials
  - schizophrenia
- brain scans to see what happens at the moment of realization of associative memory. I think this would be close to what ancient people described as "being touched by an angel" or "speaking with god".
- quality of life (of all minds): humans, animals, plants, fish, cells, atoms, etc. There is probably a boundary.

#### Drugs

- mushrooms
- alcohol
- marijuana

Drugs would have been greatly feared if you were to get lost in your associative memory. This could be related to schizophrenia, which could then be interpretted as a witch. My own mother was schizophrenic, and committed suicide when I was 15 years old. While it is not well understood as of this writing, I imagine it has something to do with an associative spiral that is not grounded in any core base, and so draws illogical conclusions.

However, drugs have been shown to greatly enhance creativity, and many of the great minds in history used them.

Everything we consume that affects our brain is effectively a drug. It is only the ones where we recognize it has a significant effect in others, where they start to speak of things we cannot understand (make associations) that we get afraid and then ban them.

#### Education

- there is something about "going down the rabbit hole" and getting into the grove that hasn't been much studied outside of "Flow" psychology. But this could be used to create immersive virtual reality games where the sound is a shared language for knowledge and experience exchange.
- as we gain more and more sensors, it may become common place where we stream our experiences to some sort of decentralized mind, and then can _tune in_ to any one of our friends or family members or loved ones, to share an experience with them.
- we need to train everyone, or give them a chance to learn
- now we can understand the power of story. Story is a sharing of direct experience, which in the past was done using this sound memory system.
- Tool gave me the inspiration :) (time signatures in music as a place to start looking)
- many people are unhappy in todays world. this could be a cause for crime, and things like school shootings. lack of a simple way to share new knowledge means everyone has a different view of the world, and we have to resort to primitive techniques such as politics to sort them out. But there is too much information today for any individual or small group of humans to decide on alone, without the direct input of everyone else. eventually it seems we will not have to work, the mind will work for us. This would mean we can spend more time doing things we love like spending time with others, or exploring new possibilities, rather than sacrificing a large part of our life to work.

#### Society

- politics wont be necessary with a large mind
- this papers demonstrates how minds always lead to greater happiness for all peers
- however, there are very important security implications, just like the internet has today. We have to research to deal with "cancers" of different types essentially.
- we have to have a _shared_ knowledge base, a sort of new tower of babel. This time we wont make the same mistake, because it's written down. And we can add to it as necessary, and verify it with mathematical proof. Therefore, we won't have to debate what is right or wrong anymore and can move on to enjoy our lives more deeply. formal language, the "term tree", which can be morphed into any shape through associative operations.
- with 3d printing, everyone on earth may soon have everything they need to be happy. with virtual reality and the internet, everyone can be intimately connected. with associative memories passed around through some sort of sound or music, we could literally be in the same experience as one of our loved ones.
- one of the harder problems we will face next will be how to inform those who do not know about this system. We could, for example, teach the dolphins, or the crows how to use an associative mind perhaps. But then they would no longer be like crows are today. So this means we can easily create evolutionary branching. We thus need a very deep and complete theory of when it is okay to branch in different evolutionary directions.

## Conclusion

There is no conspiracy to destroy the world. All of the religions are right. All of the sciences are right. They are all different pieces to the associative puzzle, which was lost because it was never written down. Some sort of event(s) occurred which must have "corrupted" the memory system, which may be what is referred to by the "flood".

Religions are civilizations form of keeping the lost knowledge, while science is a way of regaining it through observation, experience, and writing. Past kings maybe wanted to do good, but because of their limited perspective because lack of communication technology, they made painful mistakes. Leaders of companies and nations also I think want to do good, but they don't devote enough time

The evidence showing that all humans desire a good word is fairly self explanatory. The main problem has been the lack of a shared language and a lack of validation of beliefs. Also, because associative memory allows you to learn and remember orders of magnititude more information, there is a large gap in understanding between those who take advantage of it and those who don't. It is almost like us trying to talk to our pets: there is some shared language, but not enough.
