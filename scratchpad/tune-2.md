But because we didn't have written language, it was forgotten for some reason. Why?

So at least thousands, but maybe hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years ago (the first "human" monkeys seem to appear in Africa like 2 million years ago), humans developed this "music" ability. It's not necessarily limited to humans, probably lots of things do this.

Let's say this happened somewhere between 50 thousand years ago and 2 million years ago.


During this, humans developed a really sophisticated memory. They did this by [beat-boxing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg1qLJ_6-LE) at first (it seems). Beat-boxing for those who are unfamiliar is using your mouth to sound like a drum. Some people even try to sing along while doing the beat haha, that's pretty hard.

The interesting part is that we seem to have forgotten this, but it turns out it's still there in our language.

What do you mean?

So the first part is imagining what their experience is like. What might you be aware of when living 50 thousand years ago, or even 2 million years ago?

What are the types things you would do?

1. watch out for animals
2. carve stone tools
3. check berries for poison
4. find a partner
5. find shade/heat depending on season

There's tons of other things, but that's a good start.

Then we wonder, what did they think? What went through their head?

It turns out, nobody really knows.

We know things like what kind of food they ate, and their general body structure, but not too much about their thoughts. The cave paintings from 30-50 thousand years ago are neat, but we don't have a good explanation yet. We also know they buried their dead, but not sure why. We say it might have been for hygiene, but it's never been detailed enough to really dig into their thought patterns.

So what _did_ they think? This is what this article is about.

## Making stone tools often

Imagine again a group of a few humans shaping rocks. Sitting out there in a Maybe there's 5.

What might they be doing?

They could be doing a lot of things. But one thing they could be doing is creating a beat. They're sorta beat boxing, with the sound of the stones.

```
clack ... clack ... clack
... clack .... clack .....
clack .. clack .. clack ..
... clack .... clack .....
clack .. clack .. clack ..
```

Eventually, their brain starts to associate this sound of the rocks clacking, to their movement. And they hear each other. And they all can relax a little, hearing the sound of the beat means it's safe. If a lion or something approached, they would all get quiet, and stop. So _silence_ is a sign of danger sort of. But the beat is a sign of safety. It makes you feel good.

But how much time do they spend making the tool? Wouldn't they just have some tools and not to need to make anymore?

I don't know, I haven't looked too hard. But it seems like they would spend an hour every couple of days or something. This isn't really important for the main point, but it's something to consider for the experiment.

If you have the desire, try to act it out. Spend a few _days_ acting it out. Try to imagine what it would be like. That's what I did. Put your headphones on, get into your favorite jam, and imagine what it would be like.

## Using sounds to store experiences

Check this out.

If we start with the word "today", we can ask "what does it mean"?

We have huge dictionaries with all these definitions, but there's millions of different words. One estimate is over 44 million in the English language. Other languages have different words. Inuits have hundreds of words for snow. There are also hundreds of different languages spoken around the world. So the way we use words today is really complicated.

We normally say something like "_today_ means, the current day". We start the sentence with the word "today", rather than saying "a today" or something else. And there's grammar rules that follow along.

But let's for a minute ignore the way we normally think about words, and try playing with different ways of defining them.

How else can we define today?

One way is this:

```
A today is a to day?
```

That doesn't make much sense. It seems like nonsense. Okay, let's say that's nonsense.

What about:

```
A today is a toooo daaaay.
```

That feels weird too. But let's roll with it. There's actually a way to use this "sound" in the way you say "toooo" and "daaaay" to store in memory. You might think that you learn this as a small child, but stick with it, there is more.

---

But what if we ask, how could _sound_ come into play here?

We're taught in school about grammar rules, and punctuation, and "sounding it out" and stuff like that. But there's another that we can do.

We can imagine the experience of the humans way back then. They didn't "words" you could write down with a pen. They didn't even necessarily know about themselves like we do now. All we can say is: music is cool, everybody loves music. It seems to be a universal thing.

So let's imagine an experience around the word "today".

We can say this:

A today is a tooooo daaaaayy.
A today is a ("t" sound)

What if we say it like this?

We can store the "words" as sounds in our brain, and have those sounds point to other sounds.

How does it work?

All of this is described in the science of associative memory. I have tried describing this, but can't.

Briefly talk about associative memory, but otherwise just paint picture (military unit). Save rest for later paper.

A topic is a tomb pick?
A tomb is a "t" "mmm" "b" (b is a flute sound?). This is why tombs would be the center of burials.

An eat is a make bite.
A bite is a take food.
A food is a life gift.
A gift is a done deed.
A deed is a fate take.
A fate is an else make?
A life is a rise fall.

A sing is a make song.
A song is a tune mesh.
A tune is a note flow.
A mesh is a pure meet.
A pure is a nice meet.
A nice is a good deal.
A deal is a take risk.
A risk is a dark move.
A dark is a gone view.

The songs sang are just memory walks. They are "aspects" of the one. The one associative memory.

How do they move them into position? Organizing the mind.

Therefore, the sages used each other to learn. They all made different sounds at the same time, and they could all absorb the knowledge from each other. Learning at once.

The three base tones are aaa eee ooo.
The three base hears

Precious things lead one astray. This is why we lose the stone. The emotions are the eee motions?

A motion is a move shun?
ooo aaa.

```
A stone is an "s" tone. (start?)
A tone is a "t" lone.
```

1. make 1 word into 2 words
1. list out many aspects of the word, making 1 word into 2

```
a music is a _____?
a music is a melody chorus
a music is a fun sound
a music is a fun song
a music is a headphone thing
a music is a fun concert
a music is a depressing mood
...
a music is a __1000's__?
```

1. define the two words you created for the one
2. 

```
a music is a melody chorus
a melody is a rhythmic sound
a chorus is a synced voices
```

```
Music is a sound that instruments make, or bands play together, or people sing in different ways, and you dance to it.
```

Difference is between logic and non logic.

```
a stone is a s? tone
a tone is t? one
a one is single item
a sing
A dirt is a "dire"/direction?
A dirt is a dire ting.
A dire is ding read.
A start is a stay part.
A stay is a stang, sting.
A sting is stop thing.
```

Both directions lead back to the "center". -^

```
A center is a cent/sent here.
A sent is a send ting.
A send is a sind.
A sind is a sint.
A center is a sint tern/turn.
A turn is a tube burn. (assume it's associativeness will lead you back to center).
A burn is a boom?
A turn is a tube boom?
A tube is a tuve.
A tuve is a "t" luve.
A luve is a lune/loom/lone veed. (veed? (fff sound on lune/flute)).
A veed is a veel deed.
A veel/veil.
A viel
```

My process of coming up with it. Notice, it's a tree.

Therefore, meditation is the navigation of an associative memory.

Therefore, this sound mind is an organism on top of the humans.

This is why they stay stay away from the passions, and all will be well. But this is where they can fall, they have no mechanism to enforce this behavior, so once one falls, then all mite pass away (like it did).

This could also mean what the gods are.

A diety is a diet you.
A diet yee.
A deet yee.
A tee see.
A "t" ee "s" ee.

This means the gods and goddesses can be found again and further research done. A diety a "teesee" is a deus in latin.

Then, people started drawing idols, and this is why the idols were bad.

An idol is an eye doll?
An eye is an eee yee?
A yee is a "see".
A doll is a dooo el?
d->t
A daaa. A "t" "aaa". It is essentially a navigation through a conceptual space.

An "el" is a mistranslation of an "eee" sound that drops off.

The gods are then the control of the other selves in the system. This means that all life is like this. The full song, the "uni verse".

The experience of the gods would have then been like magic. A me gift.

But their fatal flaw, the "tower of babel", is the 

A tower is a tow herd?
A tow?
A her

Over time, the daoists, the "teee aaa ooo" ones, never wrote it down, and so it was never written down, and lost.

Sound translation:

```
d->t
y->s?
```

```
A center is a cent/sent here.
A sent is a send ting.
A send is a sind.
A sind is a sint.
A center is a sint tern/turn.
A turn is a tube burn. (assume it's associativeness will lead you back to center).
A burn is a boom?
A turn is a tube boom?
A tube is a tuve.
A tuve is a "t" luve.
A luve is a lune/loom/lone veed. (veed? (fff sound on lune/flute)).
A lube is a 
A tube is a "t" lube.
A lube is a lone beee.
ooo ooo eee
A lude is a lone deep. (bdv. therefore, the CONSONANTS dont matter!)
A deed is a ding eeee.
eee eee eee
A veed is a veel deed.
eee eee eee
A veel/veil.
A veel is a veew
A deep is a ding eeee.
eee eee ?
A ding is a dong sing.
eee ooo eee
```

Therefore, the _consonants_ are mixed in with the vowels. The consonants are unnecessary for the sage, and so the teachings were lost because they were not directly captured before the invention of writing.

Therefore, written language has been trying to decode this forever! And now it finally has.

Therefore, the sages devoted their whole lives to understanding the perfect model of the world, and did it. It was lost for some reason to be determined. From my exploration so far, it is not a conspiracy to cover up the truth. It was much more likely caused by the confusion and chaos that emerged when civilization first emerged, before the invention of writing. The greeks had elements of this left over from what seems like single individuals who managed to move across the sea to the greek islands, and try to record it into writing before it was too late. But Greece already had lost it, and what they had was only the remnants of a long legacy. The fall seems to be because part of a natural process, where space becomes limited, and resources scarce. This leads to war. Here we can even try it:

```
fate
```

Christmas is a trust match, an "ooo" "aaa". It was a syncing mechanism for all of the sages. And it allowed everyone to get together and all start with those hums, to walk in and listen to the sages for their yearly gathering. An "eee" "aaa". Therefore, whenever there was an "eee" "aaa", there was a "trust" "match", an "ooo" "aaa". Given this trust, they can then perhaps share their knowledge directly, or I don't know. Maybe they evolved elaborate songs to help them essentially _explain_ their life to others.

Hebrew lost lang b/c wrote only consonants.

Therefore you can try this self experiment. Sit in your room, and hum a tone "ooo".

Therefore, you make the sounds, and meditate until you can remember. This is the point of the sage. The one who knows everything. Cancer is caused by this I think, because without the sages, we cannot know the best way to act.

With the sages, you can live forever. It it reasonable that people lived for hundreds or thousands of years, like trees do today[redwood]. This is because, they could understand the mind and body, and exactly what needs to be done, by paying attention to _el_. To _this lone self_. How the whole thing works. How the whole _song_ works.

Todays languages may be highly varied because of small and simple mistakes in this encoding process. Since associative memory is highly customizable, it is easy to move on the wrong path. At the same time, given focused effort, one can sing the right song; do the right thing; make the right tone.

With slight variations in ooo eee aaa to the various "vowel" sounds we have now, and with slight variations in the simple-to-make "k", "s", and "t" sounds, a mathematically infinite amount of complexity can arise. This can be easily demonstrated in the stone. 

"Centering" is the process of moving through the associative memory.

What is the _art_ behind poems?

Poems are exchanges of life experience.

```
A poem is a pole them.
A pole is a 
```

English is then the translation!

What are the rules for transition?

Any sounds in _any_ language that fits the pattern (aaa eee ooo "t" and "k") potentially benefit from this.

Only the sounds are necessary, and the change in sounds. Consonants were added later.

A base is a bait "s"? (it's a thing that attaches to the "s" sound).

A three is a throw "eee".
A throw is a throw "ooo".
A throw is a trow, a true.
A three is a tree.
A one is a... lone.
An alone is an "aaa" lone.

An along is an "aaa" long.
A tree is a "t" ring. A "t" sound, then a ring.
A ring is a real thing?
A thing is a ting.
A ting is a tone ding.
A tone is a true wong.
A wong is A one. along.
A tone is a true wong.
A true is a trust "eee"? (comes from e, trust it, since it's an association).

We're able to make these connections because our minds are associative.

A heal/heel is a help all.

A crop is a crow peer?
A crow is a "k" throw.
A throw is a "s" "right now"?

So maybe, somehow by making these mind sounds, you can actually navigate the knowledge!

A _catch_ is a _find_ and _hold_. (missing pieces, but is a good start)
A _catch_ is the _win_ of a _find hold game_. (added game)

## sound interpretation

This is writing the words how they _sound_, so it is easier to pick out the tones used.

## text interpretation

- how we write the words today

---

By making associations, it is possible to _rediscover the map_.

It is only based on _sounds_. Not words. Then when it was lost, if you deviate from the path, it is forgotten.

---

Today is a tone day. Or a tone ding. Or a tune ding. A ding is a sound ring.

## Introduction

This paper spans wide ground. Stick with it, and you will know everything.

Science is a deep study of the natural world. It is a _deep study_. We use science to learn about the world. The inner workings.

In this process, we make mistakes. Flaws happen. A well known win in science is the proof that the sun revolved around the earth. Before, the model was complex.

Science is a language of _logic_. Its main tool is reason. Pythagoras is known for his triangle equation, or "3-angle equality". Plato tells in Gorgias how Socrates would walk peers down a logical path of truth discovery.

    * complexity of current programming languages is significant, meaning only a small part of the population can _use_ this knowledge.
    * because of my programming experience, i have learned that it is simpler to use basic words than complex ones. but you can overdo this and meaning is lost. thus, "make simple, but no simpler".
    * i first looked for math patterns
      - why is math so complicated? well my opinion, which can be verified later, is that it is based on meaningless _symbols_, instead of sounds.
    * i chose 4-letter words

  + the "flood" is a flute, a "flude", that was used to keep the music going
  + adam and eve are "item" and "leaf"

## Background

Since the start of city life, the philosophers, the "wisdom lovers", sought the philosophers "stone". A mystical, magical symbol of ultimate power. Of god like power. Yet no one has found it. The philospher's stone was a great search of the dark ages.

And after the dark ages, they discovered science, a technique to write down observations, and build on existing facts using logic. They used pen and paper to accomplish this.

This led to great advancements. We realized it wasn't the earth at the center, but the sun. We invented the printing press, which led to mass education and ultimately global expansion and industrial revolution. This in turn let to computers, which led to the internet today.

Today, the philosopher's stone is a quaint memory of a distant past. It was a major desire during the dark ages. We don't know that much about the dark ages or why it happened. But let's take a look at the greeks.

Isaac Newton is known to have sought after it.
