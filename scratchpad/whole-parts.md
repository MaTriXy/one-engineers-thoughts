If people could just list out the problems, that would be a full time job.

Learn how to cooperatively solve problems. How to jump around from psychology to business, to software development. And you can solve specific problems in each field efficiently. The reason this doesn't happen is because certain people disagree with the person, who have been working hard on it themselves. So they want to prevent them from getting the boost to their reputation, making useless all the work the other person did. We have to be willing to lose all our work, and to have others do it for us. Maybe everybody can have nice place to live and lots of food, but they can't have the intelligent freedoms if they don't participate in some way.

So how can you be okay with someone you perceive as an amateur (someone who doesn't have as much skill as you do), getting all the credit for your work? You can do this if your work is always integrated into the whole. This way, the other persons work will always be developed from yours, since it cuts out all the work for him. This way, we could move super fast.

You just have to be okay if the whole doesn't go exactly where you want it to go.
