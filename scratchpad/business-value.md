The _value prop_ is painting a picture for your customer, so that they can realize they have a problem and would be much better off if that problem were solved. It has to be a very intuitive step that doesn't require any mental energy. It needs to be _obvious_. This is creating a super high-level problem.

Once they realize the high-level problem exists, you've planted the seed in their mind that their life could be better.

So they will be wondering at a high-level, how is it possible to solve this problem?

And then you show a possible solution, eventually getting to your product. A clear pathway from a problem in their life, to the product.

You must first just help the users _visualize_ how much better they will be. How their future self is awesome. This will instill a desire in them to get there. Once the desire is there, they have a problem, which your product solves.

If you have many customers, craft a value prop for each _customer segment_. For each value proposition, you must identify the customer segment that converts the best.

"better" just means a future envisioned state is closer to their ideals of the perfect life than the current state.
