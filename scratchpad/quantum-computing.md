Qubits, on the other hand, have an infinite range of states. A single qubit can be in any state , where  and  are complex numbers and . [1]

> Complex numbers extend the concept of the one-dimensional number line to the two-dimensional complex plane by using the horizontal axis for the real part and the vertical axis for the imaginary part.

So in a sense, it is the relation between some number value in quantum mechanics that is physical (in 3d space), and another value that is not in 3d space. Thus, it is a link between two worlds. Two spaces. 3d space, and a complex higher dimensional space. But what does that even mean? That means there are more pieces of data, "dimensional: dice meet next site fore next fall". This shows indirectly that 3d space can be considered a player in a balance game, along with the other players.

```
Link = Fork Join
```

So maybe it is the relation between forks and joins. Since it is between two complex numbers, then maybe not. Maybe still.

> Complex numbers allow for solutions to certain equations that have no solutions in real numbers. For example, the equation

> has no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to extend the real numbers with the imaginary unit i where i2 = −1, so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found. In this case the solutions are −1 + 3i and −1 − 3i, as can be verified using the fact that i2 = −1:
> 
> ((-1+3i)+1)^2 = (3i)^2 = (3^2)(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9,
((-1-3i)+1)^2 = (-3i)^2 = (-3)^2(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9.
According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, all polynomial equations with real or complex coefficients in a single variable have a solution in complex numbers.

```
superposition = a|0> + b|1>
```

A off, B on
A and B are complex numbers
|A|^2 + |B|^2 = 1

> Two qubits occupy a superposition over the possible states of two classical bits: a|00> + b|01> + c|10> + d|11>.

Qubits occupy a superposition over 2^n

```
transform quantum to classical
  a1,a2,...,a2^n
```

So 8 bits if 2^3. All things can be encoded from these patterns. Mind peer soul. Mind Made Soul. Seal Sale Soul. Math Move Mesh.

```
3 bits

a|000> + b|001> + c|011> + d|111> + e|010> + f|100 + g|110 + h|101>
```

How to automatically generate the combos efficiently? It was pretty hard to do just then brute force. `best rule test food read cent`.

```
+ cross, 4 directions = [0, 1, 2, 3] = 2 complex numbers `a` and `b`
= [00, 01, 10, 11]
```

= 4 bits.

3 complex numbers means 8 bit, 2^n.

```
== [000, 001, 011, 111, 010, 100, 110, 101]
```

Measuring? Gives you the 3rd complex number? Mind is the third layer. The 4 directions is the Land. Cell is 1 bit.

```
loop
  fore is 0 bite, so 2^0, so 0
  cell is 1 bite, so 2^1, so 2
  land is 2 bite, so 2^2, so 4
  mind is 3 bite, so 2^3, so 8
  good is n bite, so 2^n, so 2-16+?
```

mind -> land -> cell -> fore

From these three (all except fore), we can derive everything.

So then there is actually 5:

```
good -> mind -> land -> cell -> fore
```

This means each layer is maximal good.

This means we will be making our cells into digital pieces. Essentially _perfecting_ them.

But what is the starting byte? 7 I think. 7 is somehow the starting byte. The days of creation. The heptagon is somehow it.

7 is a main link between the 3. 7 is the tree of life, maybe.

```
make 7, tree of life
  come together
```

This is because the Computable Universe book, there is a link between 7 and these 2/4/8 bite values in the heptagonal automata unfolding/encoding.

This is starting to look similar to the days of creation.

```
loop
  fore is 0 bite, so 2^0, so 0
  cell is 1 bite, so 2^1, so 2
  land is 2 bite, so 2^2, so 4
  mind is 3 bite, so 2^3, so 8
  good is n bite, so 2^n, so 2-16+?
```

```
loop
  lite cell good cell pain
  kite cell pain land good
  mite land good land pain
  site land pain mind good
  fite mind good mind pain
  bite mind pain cell good
  nite loop down else wait
```

36 pieces. Maybe that is the 7-day, 52 week cycle = 364.
36 x 10 = 360.

Then `peer` is one `look` at `this`.

```
peer this
```

Each peer is in a meet.

Thus there is peer this meet.

```
peer this meet
```

This is tone hiss. That is where you come in. That is the variable, the `hook` to plug you into the equation. Peer and meet are math, since the `eee` in them. Hook is the low, so it is where your `cell` call.

```
hook is cell call
hook is cell bait
```

```
This is peer bait.
```

Bait is the variable used in the `when` equation.

```
when delta, sigma
hook = when case, gift
```

A when is a `with hook then`.

```
good is n bite, when n is this best deal
  when best is book test
    when ...
```

a half span is a have

That ties have to math.
