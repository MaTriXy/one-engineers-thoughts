1. Map out key terms in a field. After having read through and found the patterns of the common terms. You don't need to know exactly their definition, just know that they are important and useful. Now, just create a list of those terms, and organize them into categories. Basically, give them types. Tips: Keep it very low level. Separate out every term combination into the bare terms. This results in the _spanning terms_ essentially.
2. With the list of spanning terms, now find the useful combinations. Go back through the documents a second time, searching for those exact terms. Find their definition. Maybe just look up the term on Wikipedia, to get the real name. Result in a list of term combinations that need to be defined/modelled.
3. Define the terms so they are all consistent. Make sure terminology doesn't expand unless we just missed an important definition. Now you have all the terms defined in the original language. This should be enough information to read and understand the text to extract out the mathematical definitions now. Because now you know what they are talking about.
4. Simplify the terminology. Draw pictures using the terminology, and using experience, identify simple ways of describing the same thing. Come up with a way of thinking about the information that is easy and natural for a human. To do this, need to have a mental model of common simple ways to understand things.
5. Formalize a transformation between original and simplified versions of the model. Verify that they are equivalent.
