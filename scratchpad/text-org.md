A baby born, quickly sees two heads, and knows "k", the creative time where you play and make.

Book is a band started by Lance Pollard, Randy Hamama, and Craig Smith in 2001. Originally they proposed the name "scapegoat", but that didn't stick for very long. Ty Caudle was also practiced with us at times, who was a master at freestyle in the English language. He is now a bar tender in San Francisco.

Book also makes plain art that makes sense. It uses different forms of natural language to create meaningful pieces that appeal to a wide audience.

Text is where Book where keeps the main notes. These are notes contributed by peers from every part of the world, used by Book in their music. They want all people to have access to good music, because "music soothes the soul".

Their first book is called Main. It is also their last book. It is a continuously evolving **b**eat that h**oo**_k_s and **k**eeps going.
