- Build out model language for a few years, use it and refine it til it's pretty solid.
- Write paper on it to the scientific community, "The Model Language: A Programming Language for Scientific Modeling" under lance@tropon.org, or "M: A Programming Language for Scientific Modelling"
- Hire top researcher in specific fields and work with them to model something in their field (biology, physics, etc.). Publish a paper in the popular scientific journal for that field. In these papers, maybe compare performance and ease of development to other languages like C (clearly shows this is the best investment).
- Write a collective paper with researchers in other fields who love the model language, "The Principles of Scientific Modeling"
- During the time with the researchers, be working with sales people to get accounts with enterprises, potentially collecting their data in a private project for a fee to process certain ways, or how much they load. And anything that is publicly available will be free.

So then it's like, we get a few papers out to the scientific community, which builds trust, respect, and authority so it's easier to get the business from the enterprises, which will fund hiring more researchers to build out core models and such.
