tao te ching is best logic without having a formally defined written symbol system. It is before that was even imaginable as a possible solution. So they spent generations refining their observations about their experience, given only an awareness of their experience but not an awareness of written math and it's feedback-loop to our self awareness. This means the tao te ching is just random poems, but a complete model of reality from human experience at that time.
