A name is a mathematical sound/letter sequence.

3 states, with 12 faces (11 inside, not counting main, 5 5 1). Breaks into 5 sides.
12 faces, 5 sides, 3 states.

7 sides, 3 states

Then with still just those 3 states, you can also make 12 or 5. 5 + 7 = 12.

11/2 states

So maybe there are ways to transition between shapes. You can stay in cycles of 7, or you can balance cycles of 7 with cycles of 12. And from there, you can balance patterns of 5 (what we recognize easily, because of our hands). From 5 you can go 10 perhaps and get into pure numbers. From 12 and 5 you can do 60. 12 pentagons is 60 sides.

With 6 and 60 you can do 360, or 12 and 30.

4 is 7 - 3. 4 and 4 can make 8. 2 can be used for bits, for m and n, for good and bad.

Fibonacci is just one possible doubling pattern in an "isolated system" sorta thing. But there could be many such combinatory patterns. Combine 8/2, then 7/3, then 4/6 (7-3, 8-2), or whatever combinations. So the way these things can evolve perhaps can be endless. But maybe some lead to a gain in information rather than a loss. For all members of the network. That is, as the network evolves, only perform actions that don't harm the group (that don't bring the group down). Perhaps there is a duration for how long a process persists without "providing any value" (to use product terms). This would essentially mean "death". But as long as you provide some value, and aren't pulling the group down (taking value away yet not giving back), then maybe that is what is considered "good".
