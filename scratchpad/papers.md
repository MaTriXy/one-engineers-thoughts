Source: Rethinking the Program Console

The console is an interface to the digital world. It should be easy for every one of us to interact with. It should connect to all forms of data. And it should teach us how to get to know it better, and we will see the world much more deeply.

The early computer pioneers were dealing with a complex political environment and a pressure to get returns on investment. Yet they were endlessly passionate about their work. Because they were rushed, they did not have the time to consider how to build the API so that all of us can understand. They abbreviated words, because it was easy for them to keep track of. It was what they grew up with. These were the few to master the short and terse mathematical formulas in their college classes. {Paint a picture of them working on their language, what they wore, where they went to school, who their teachers were, etc. And what they got for their birthdays}

What resulted is a highly abbreviated language API. It is much less abbreviated than math, but it didn't have the time to simplify it was originally envisioned.

This paper suggests we take the time to organize an API that everyone in the world can understand, so we can make it easy for all to participate.

Source is one experiment to see what a simpler program console and programming interface would feel like.
