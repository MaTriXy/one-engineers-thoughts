This conversation we had tells me you don't trust how I solve problems, so you have to solve them directly.

Everything you are pointing out, I have pointed out in the past. Maybe not as directly to you, but I think of all these things.

We spent 25 minutes at the start of my day, right when I'm the most productive, talking about how exactly I code.

But today, it seems like he thinks that is too much work and has been slow to respond to my issues unless I ask him in chat. So he would rather do them in chat:

Vince isn't even paying attention to my updates:
