> In Mesoamerican myth the flood was but one of several destructions of the creation - usually the first of three or four such cataclysmic events, although there is some evidence that the Aztecs considered the flood to be the fourth of them.

> The Mexica/Aztec were said to be guided by their god Huitzilopochtli, meaning "Left-handed Hummingbird" or "Hummingbird from the South." At an island in Lake Texcoco, they saw an eagle holding a rattlesnake in its talons, perched on a nopal cactus. This vision fulfilled a prophecy telling them that they should found their new home on that spot. The Aztecs built their city of Tenochtitlan on that site, building a great artificial island, which today is in the center of Mexico City. This legendary vision is pictured on the Coat of Arms of Mexico.

prophecy: predicting the future: creating a specification

A prophecy is a prediction of the future without knowing the logical proof. It is more a gut feeling prediction, based on "supernatural forces" (aka, things we dont know how to explain yet).

> Another story states that pulque was discovered by the Tlacuache [t͡ɬaˈkʷat͡ʃe] (opossum), who used his human-like hands to dig into the maguey and extract the naturally fermenting juice. He became the first drunk. Tlacuache was thought to set the course of rivers.

> For the Indians of the central highlands of Mexico, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during certain festivals, such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. It was drunk by priests and sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim.

> The Navajo creation story traces the evolution of life through four previous worlds until the people reach the fifth and present world. As the humans passed through each of the previous four worlds, they went through evolution. They started out as insects and various animals until they became humans in the Fourth World.[7]

The 5th world is the world of the hand, the world we are aware of?

> The tonalpohualli Nahuatl pronunciation: [toːnaɬpoːˈwalːi], a Nahuatl word meaning "count of days", is an Aztec version of the 260-day calendar in use in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. This calendar is neither solar nor lunar, but rather consists of 20 (veintenas), 13-day (trecenas) periods. Each trecena is ruled by a different deity.

To get out of the negative association spiral, you first have to identify a false negative prediction you made, after it becomes false. It must be obviously false to you in that current state. So if you cant find your computer, and think someone stole it, then find it a few seconds later, then that is where your negative prediction was false. This snaps you back closer to an objective, balanced outlook. It is like you want to always come from a place of objective balance with the current situation.

You forget that the butterfly feeling in the stomach is the brain telling the body that you made some logical jump that doesn't make sense, so you are basically a fish out of water.
