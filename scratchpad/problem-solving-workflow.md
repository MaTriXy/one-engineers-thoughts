Ideal with problems: break into micro-tasks simple enough that you could do them without knowing anyting.

Practical goal: break into micro-tasks small enough that you, with your domain knowledge, can perform them without thinking.

The difference between these two is domain knowledge. So to do tasks effectively, you may need to acquire domain knowledge.

A task is a project technically. A project is just typically a larger task. A project is a set of tasks/instructions, which could just be 1.

As you start working, you run into _problems_. For example, I started building an overlay component, and realize there has never been a "global" UI component implemented in Deku before. So, since this problem isn't solved, have to add it to the "problem queue" sort of thing. It's these things that you can't always predict. So a _project_ has unforeseen _problems_. The goal is to minimize the need to fully solve these unforeseen problems, while also making sure you are going to improve your future problem solving ability (i.e. not run into the same problem again). The solutions can be manual, if you don't have time to build an automated one, but at least you have a solution. Better have a manual solution than a hope to implement a robust one, not having any usable solution at all.
