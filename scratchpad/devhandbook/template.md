This is like the "standard case" page. Quick and to the point. If you want more details, go to the exact API page.

```
[main example]
```

Then down here, a bunch of different ways you can use the API. This is based on the tests we have for the action, perhaps.

Notes

- use variables instead of values, so they can copy/paste code easier
- show effect visually if possible
- have a list of variables being used, so the user can change the value, and see how it effects the outcome
- write code using best practices from community
- let people select their default format for their code.
- figure out how to automatically determine if modules form "layer of abstraction" on top of an api. if there are no layers of abstraction, then let them no that nobody has built a module for this one yet, with link to start of module for it.

All the code on this site is free to use without restriction. Any underlying libraries that are used though, it's up to you to check their licenses. As long as it's on GitHub with MIT or BSD or Apache or something you've seen before, you should be fine.
