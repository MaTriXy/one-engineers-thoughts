# File Creation Libraries in Node.js

<!-- list of github projects that solve this problem, perform this action -->

There are many existing node modules out there to create files:

- a
- b
- c

You can find documentation for those here as well.

Here's how you would create files in those libraries:

```js
createFile()
create_file()
```

In terms of comparison, we compare them here... A is better than b in x situation. C is better that B in y situation. A uses camelCase, so if your team is using camelcase, may want to avoid that.

<!-- Maybe compare performance to each other, performance comparison! Maybe compare, eventually, to other programming languages. Helps people choose between programming languages. -->
