# This is a story of Jack and Jill

This is a story
about jack and jill.
They play with words
And drum and thrill.

Jack and jill
went up a hill
And found a pale of water.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And Jill came tumbling after.

This is a story
We all know well.
But the words we read.
Like "jack" and "jill",
we assume to be boy and girl.

A boy, we think
is that over there.
[drawing of boy]
A girl, we say
is this over here.

But what is it that is really the girl?

Is it her hair?
Is it her hand?
Is it her fair skin?
Or the one we make thin?

And what really is it that's really the boy?

Is it his strength?
Is it his height?
Is it his hard fist?
Or the one we make fall?
<!--Or is it his ripe dick?-->

Is it neither,
or is them all?

Jack is a male.

Why are we picking these random words.

A _peer_ is a pick deer.
A deer is a deal peer.
A deal is a deed real.
A deed is a done need.

Why are you picking these random words?

Notice the tree branch.
Watch the three dance.
Hear the song chant.
Feel the last chance.

chance is chase lance
  chase is chop case
  lance is land cent
    land is late sand
      late is last tent
        last is long past
          long is load song
            (there is some way these vowels are related to each other here)
    sand is 

a is b c
  b is d e
  c is f g

What shapes do these form?

a triangle
  a tri angle
    a tree i
    a sang lead

a square
  a squad reef
    a song quad
    a song quad reef

a circle
  a circ lead

a line

The Roud Folk Song Index classifies this tune and its variations as number 10266

Before there was even fire, there was tools. Tools and sounds. There are always sounds. But not always fires.

> Cooking plant foods might trigger brain expansion by allowing complex carbohydrates in starchy foods to become more digestible and allow humans to absorb more food energy per unit of food consumed.

> Other anthropologists argue that the evidence suggests that cooking fires began in earnest only 250,000 BP, when ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint appear across Europe and the Middle East.[21] Two million years ago, the only sign of fire is burnt earth with human remains, which most other anthropologists consider to be mere coincidence rather than evidence of intentional fire.[22] The mainstream view among anthropologists is that the increases in human brain-size occurred well before the advent of cooking, due to a shift away from the consumption of nuts and berries to the consumption of meat.[23][24]

Nuts -> Meats -> Fire (cooking) -> Drugs?
(plant fruit) -> (brain fruit) -> (fire means more brain and plant fruit)

```
cook is heat with fire
boil is cook with soup

plant fruit
brain fruit

tree seed (very generic)
cook tree seed (heat with fire)
feed cook tree seed
  smoke from fire
  flesh from fire
  warmth from fire
  smell fire
  sleep by fire
  feel fire
  camp fire
  play with fire
  dance around fire
  sing with fire
  sing with each peer
  chant by the fire
  all the things you can do by the fire
```

Progression of growing mind factors.

So the fire, cook, nut tree words would have been first. That is because they were the most common. They could also be way later, where we eventually went back to describing trees. We would have to check much deeper for evidence to support either case.

Ballpark I want to say these words camp fire came about 200,000 years ago.

How did the words evolve? That is probably encoded in them too! It must be. Have faith?

```

```coffee
# this helps us then define the structure of the the thing in a more general mathematical way, so we can abstract away the associations, to find the general map

word evolve
  from e, earn
  from v, view (experiential)
  from o, oath (experiential, and drill down experiential (dde))
  from l, look (experiential)
  from v, veer
  from e, eyes

word evolve
  from e, eyes
  from v, view
  from o, oath
  from l, look
  from v, view
  from e, eyes

  this is, in a sense, a commandment
    it asks for you to do
    once you do, you can see

Poetry to bridge the line between math and code. Still makes sense to humans, without being pure math. Poems are perhaps a sort of normal form. Maybe they are generated. Can generate these things pretty easily from plain text too!

And it's also basically saying, "type x, ..." telling you what to type :)

> There is a not dissimilar belief in Judaism. Time is split into 3 periods (1) The world started in year 1 (= 3761 BC), the epoch. For almost two thousand years there was nothing, most people were idolatrous and God's presence was not seen in the world. (2) In 1812 BC, 1948 in Jewish years, Abraham was born. The birth of the first forefather heralded two thousand years of Godliness. This is the period of the Bible, the first and second temples in Jerusalem etc. (3) In 70 AD the Second Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed, and after the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jews were barred from Jerusalem except for the day of Tisha B'av. This started a further two thousand years of non-Godliness. Some Jews believe that the Messiah must come before the end of this period, or by about 2270 AD.

So first, nothing. Note Oath This Next Self Note Good. Game Oath Oath Deed.
Then we ran out of space, and we needed to make the mind. So we had to enter into the world of the eyes, so we could start to harness the earth. Once we could harness the earth, we could be the good. But now soon we can live in peace. Peer each arms care each. 5.

Basically, demonstrate the good, and all creatures can accept or deny the math, and those that deny are filtered out. It's like a simple algorithm. If this doesn't make sense, then what will?

But this doesn't mean you kill them and torture them like you may think. It means they don't understand how the good works. And we have to make room for them to grow too, and discover it for themselves. Or just at least do more scientific research about it. That way they will end up discovering it on their own, without having to be afraid. You get afraid when you don't know from direct experience.
