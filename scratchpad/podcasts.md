# Plan

## Websites

1. `termlang.org` For modeling stuff.
  - NO ADS
  - https://github.com/model/language-term
2. `termbook.net` The editor for termlang. Maybe called termkit.org. "An aid to your memory and imagination." This is sorta like webkit, how it's separate from javascript. Place to learn. Built on top of decentralized service, so we don't have any more control than anyone else. You can use this instead of currentmodel.org. But all links to facebook link to currentmodel.org or something, since it requires no install of anything. Similar to blo.cks.org. This is basically an efficiently platform for developers, researchers, scientists, or makers, in order to quickly model, debug, and implement ideas.
  - NO ADS
  - ability to render in b/w
  - compiler built in
  - essentially this is like node/javascript, but patternkit/termlang.
  - this is like react instead of raw javascript. Essentially the workflow tool.
  - includes problem solving, and saving data
  - includes intelligent agent.
  - https://github.com/model/kit-term
  - modelguide.org
  - termbook.org would be the place where all the models of individuals/blocks/organization/evolution/intelligent/innovation come together into an evolving book. "seed" might be what the physical book is called that gets released periodically. So termbook is the usage of all kinds of underlying models for intelligence and such. So modelpodcast would be interviewing all the researchers for those models. So in the end, based on all their research, we would have a "termbook, an interactive book of knowledge". Knowledge would be stored on a decentralized block chain thing, like tor perhaps. (don't know enough yet).
3. `elkpress.org` For creating cool blogs with stories and help for people. ADS
  1. `devhandbook.org`
  2. `factsofnature.org`
  3. `pastandpresent.org`
  4. `madeforhome.org`
  + ...
  + My name NOT on it.
4. `modelpodcast.org` For interviewing researchers about their work. To build an audience that greatly benefits from this information. Eventually they would be audience for sourcelang as a standardization on knowledge representation.
  - SPONSORS
  - My name on it
  - modelcast.org?
5. `worldnotes.org` For everyone to consume knowledge easily. The use of the editor for the general public. A place to cite anything in the decentralized database. Until it gets replaced with something better. Don't have a good domain yet. Maybe this integrates with minecraft or something. My own personal interface with ads to the source editor. This way the general public can get the info without changing anything, but can also just download the link to the source editor with the ad-free version otherwise.
  - GOOD ADS from sponsors
  - My name on it.
  - Eventually, try to direct people away, instead they should be using `termbook.org`, which is ad-free and decentralized.
  - everything from elkpress, in standard, simplified form.

Use `github.com/model` for all term trees that can be used as models/packages. Basically these are the standard models from the model podcast. But they are also stored in the decentralized network.

## Publications

Eventually could release these, not sure when yet.

1. Generalizations of Pattern Emergence / Observations about Pattern Emergence
2. Block Theory
3. Term Theory
4. Transforming Terms into Graphics
5. The Structure of Experience / Experience in Block Theory
6. The Structure of Innovation / Innovation in Block Theory
7. The Structure of Communication
8. The Structure of Interaction
9. The Structure of Organization
10. On the Origin of Information

## Domain Ideas

- nature. truenaturepodcast.org. interview nature scientists, chemists, biologists, mathematicians, and get their perspective on the world. Maybe how they came to be, what inspires them, what they think of the world. What questions they still have, etc. Parallel to factsofnature website which has all the content.
- code. Interview top coders and how they stay motivated, how they stay creative, what their best techniques are. In this site, can link to devhandbook too.
- communication. Interview people that are masters at communicating in all types of situations.

Podcasts are grouped under separate orgs instead of elkpress.

- tropon.io Maybe this is the site for the public, but it's just my take on the vastness of the knowledge in termbook. So I can put ads here, but it's just my own take on it, my imagination at work. Maybe this evolves into a game or virtual reality world of some sort. The experience of the universe.

## Music

> MySpace: Nikki Starr recommends using MySpace to find Indy bands who would be happy for the airplay. Many of them havenâ€™t signed over the rights to their music but would love to be heard.  All you need is for them to send you an MP3 and a letter granting you permission to play their tunes.
