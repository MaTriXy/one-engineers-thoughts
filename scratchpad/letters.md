> About 50,000 years ago, there was a marked increase in the diversity of artifacts. In Africa, bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archeological record. Between 45,000 and 43,000 years ago, this new tool technology spread with human migration to Europe. The new technology generated a population explosion of modern humans which is believed to have led to the extinction of the Neanderthals.
> The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits.

- camp
- dump storage pit

So then extrapolating based on these words:

- spot
- tent
- wood
- fire

Many of the things they would use would be of these shapes.

> By 40,000-50,000 BP, the first humans set foot in Australia. By 45,000 BP, humans lived at 61° north latitude in Europe.[4] By 30,000 BP, Japan was reached, and by 27,000 BP humans were present in Siberia above the Arctic Circle. At the end of the Upper Paleolithic, a group of humans crossed the Bering land bridge and quickly expanded throughout North and South America.[4]

  - 45, 50, 5, or 1
    - but with different temperature?

> He argues that almost everywhere, whether Asia, Africa or Europe, before 50,000 years ago all the stone tools are much alike and unsophisticated.

So they are traveling around the world, with the ability to draw symbolic representations of their experience. The question is, what other kinds of experiences do they express symbolically?

This is where we look at all the physical evidence that survived the past few thousand years of human history.

Neanderthals made stone tools. They were just called "unsophisticated". What does unsophisticated mean? In greek, it means not sophia related. Sophia is a god of wisdom. Let us assume that _god_ is a short notation for _good_. Let us expand wisdom into wise dome. This puts our terms into a mathematically standard form, which we have established is easy to observe from your own experience.

So now we can say "Neanderthals made non wise dome stone tools". What is the sense we get from this? That the tools were made by a non-wise dome. Well if we follow the mathematical words backwards even further, we can follow this chain of logic:

```
wise is will seek
  will is want fill
    want is wake tent
      wake is will take

      thus will take want fill (looping take)
```

The goal of this game, is to get them back to the original letters.

Now we want to narrow down to these letters:

- T (first letter that comes to mind "to me", tome)
- H (wait, the next, the letter that comes after the one to me)
- E (mind) mine deep, [min] [d], 3/1 (dig into things)
- A (hand) help land, [h] [and], 1/3
- O (soul) song pull, [so] [ul], 2/2 or [so] [u] [l] send your will?
- S (last, the sleep sound)

Theaos Theos.

So that is the sort of hypothesis.

They get enough vitamin D from meat, why white people are white?

> When the ancestors of modern man separated from apes, they were covered in hair. Little UV light reached their skin and as a result, anthropologists believe they were fair skinned. As modern humans evolved however, their body hair became finer and thinner, leaving their skin more exposed to the equatorial sun. To adapt, thier bodies produced more melanin to protect them from damaging UV rays. Increased melanin made their skin become darker.

> Neanderthals used tools of the Mousterian class, which were often produced using soft hammer percussion, with hammers made of materials like bones, antlers, and wood, rather than hard hammer percussion, using stone hammers. A result of this is that their bone industry was relatively simple.

> A 2012 study which examined a database of 1,699 ancient sites across Eurasia suggests that Neanderthals harvested bird feathers. They appear to have had a preference for raptor and corvid feathers which may have been used as personal ornaments. Co-author Professor Finlayson remarked: "What all this suggests to us is that Neanderthals had the cognitive abilities to think in symbolic terms. The feathers were almost certainly being used for ornamental purposes, and this is a quite unbelievable thing to find."[43][44]

> Research on tool use by modern wild chimpanzees in West Africa shows there is an operational sequences when chimpanzees use lithic implements to crack nuts. In the course of nut cracking, sometimes they will create unintentional flakes. Although the morphology of chimpanzees' hammer is different from Oldowan hammer, chimpanzees' ability to use stone tools indicates that the earliest lithic industries were probably not produced by only one kind of hominin species.[20]

> The makers of Oldowan tools were mainly right-handed.[21] "Handedness" (lateralization) had thus already evolved, though it is not clear how related to modern lateralization it was, since other animals show handedness as well.

> Conclusion:
> We are now closer to the minimal number of states in order to get a universal
cellular automaton on the heptagrid. Two cases remain to be studied: 3 states
and 2 states. I had a discussion with Donald Knuth on this topic. Don encouraged
me to try to find an analog of the game of life in the hyperbolic plane.
Of course, it would be very interesting to obtain such a result. Unfortunately,
the divergence of the lines and rays in the heptagrid makes it difficult to define
collisions. Moreover, the gliders are not yet known.
Accordingly, we remain with some hard work ahead.

That is the coolest conclusion ever.

> In this paper, we construct a weakly universal cellular automaton
with two states only on the tiling {11, 3}. The cellular automaton is
rotation invariant and it is a true planar one.

11 requires only 2 states!

devised for the Euclidean plane, this model can be implemented in the tessellations

{p+2, 3} which are spanned by a tree which, in each case allows a rather
easy way to implement horizontals and verticals.

> In this paper, we construct a family of weakly universal cellular automaton
for all grids {p, 3} of the hyperbolic plane for p ≥ 13. The scheme
is general for p ≥ 17 and for 13 ≤ p < 17, we give such a cellular automaton
for p = 13, which is enough. Also, an important property of this
family is that the set of cells of the cellular automaton which are subject
to changes is actually a planar set. The problem for p < 13 for a truly
planar construction is still open. The best result, for p = 7, is four states
and was obtained by the same author.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text

> By long tradition, a ritual Sefer Torah (Torah scroll) could contain only the Hebrew consonantal text – nothing added, nothing taken away. The Masoretic codices however, provide extensive additional material, called masorah, to show correct pronunciation and cantillation, protect against scribal errors, and annotate possible variants. The manuscripts thus include vowel points, pronunciation marks and stress accents in the text, short annotations in the side margins, and longer more extensive notes in the upper and lower margins and collected at the end of each book.

> The Hebrew word masorah is taken from Ezekiel 20:37 and means originally "fetter". The fixation of the text was considered to be in the nature of a fetter upon its exposition. When, in the course of time, the Masorah had become a traditional discipline, the term became connected with the verb ( = "to hand down"), and acquired the general meaning of "tradition."[citation needed]

> The history of alphabetic writing goes back to the consonantal writing system used for Semitic languages in the Levant in the 2nd millennium BCE. Most or nearly all alphabetic scripts used throughout the world today ultimately go back to this Semitic proto-alphabet.[1] Its first origins can be traced back to a Proto-Sinaitic script developed in Ancient Egypt to represent the language of Semitic-speaking workers in Egypt. This script was partly influenced by the older Egyptian hieratic, a cursive script related to Egyptian hieroglyphs.[2][3]

> A tribe known as the Latins, who became known as the Romans, also lived in the Italian peninsula like the Western Greeks. From the Etruscans, a tribe living in the first millennium BCE in central Italy, and the Western Greeks, the Latins adopted writing in about the **seventh** century. In adopted writing from these two groups, the Latins dropped four characters from the Western Greek alphabet.

> They also adapted the Etruscan letter F, pronounced 'w,' giving it the 'f' sound, and the Etruscan S, which had three zigzag lines, was curved to make the modern S. To represent the G sound in Greek and the K sound in Etruscan, the Gamma was used. These changes produced the modern alphabet without the letters G, J, U, W, Y, and Z, as well as some other differences.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Latin_alphabet

> It is generally held that the Latins adopted the western variant of the Greek alphabet in the 7th century BC from Cumae, a Greek colony in southern Italy — making the early Latin alphabet one among several Old Italic alphabets emerging at the time.

> Gaius Julius Hyginus, who recorded much Roman mythology, mentions in Fab. 277 the legend that it was Carmenta, the Cimmerian Sibyl, who altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin alphabet, which her son Evander introduced into Latium, supposedly 60 years before the Trojan War, but there is no historically sound basis to this tale.

> The oldest Latin inscriptions do not distinguish between /ɡ/ and /k/, representing both by C, K and Q according to position. K was used before A; Q was used (if at all) before O or V; C was used elsewhere.

C = not Q not K
Q = before O before V
K = before A

>  This is explained by the fact that the Etruscan language did not make this distinction. C originated as a turned form of Greek Gamma (Γ) and Q from Greek Koppa (Ϙ). In later Latin, K survived only in a few forms such as Kalendae; Q survived only before V (representing /kw/), and C was used everywhere else. G was later invented to distinguish between /ɡ/ and /k/; it was originally simply a C with an additional diacritic.

> G was later invented to distinguish between /ɡ/ and /k/; it was originally simply a C with an additional diacritic.

G was C with diacritic, with "mark" c with mark.

> The Phoenician letter is derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph depicting an ox's head[1] and gave rise to the Greek Alpha (Α), being re-interpreted to express not the glottal consonant but the accompanying vowel, and hence the Latin A and Cyrillic А.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph

> M is formed of a undulating line deriving from the hieroglyph for water, very similar to the later Semitic letter for M.
> Sumerian cuneiform was long thought to be the oldest writing, but its claim is now disputed
An ox head gradually transforms into the letter A, and a house develops into the Semitic B, or bayt.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_alphabet

> Two scripts are well attested from before the end of the fourth millennium BCE: Mesopotamian cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
> Hieroglyphs were employed in three ways in Ancient Egyptian texts: as logograms (ideograms) that represent a word denoting an object pictorially depicted by the hieroglyph; more commonly as phonograms writing a sound or sequence of sounds; and as determinatives (which provide clues to meaning without directly writing sounds)

- sight sign
- sound sign
- sense sign (diacritics, clue, hint, etc.)

Or

- tole sine (I guessed this word, ever ever seen it: definition from google "painted, enameled, or lacquered tinplate used to make decorative domestic objects.") (take thole? totem pole?)

> Although some calendrical and what might prove to be genealogical information has been identified, not even these glyphs can actually be read.

So:

1. numbers first
2. then sights
3. then sounds
4. then scenes (artwork, symbols, glyphs)
5. then letters associate sounds with symbols and sights (letters)
6. then words

1-3 took a long time.Then when they started connecting the 3: sights, sounds, and glyphs, that is the secret (stone). Those are the 3 that come together. The numbers are already well established, so (`tree tile tone`) then were transcribed into `text`.

Text goes from what you see to what you can draw, to what numbers you can find in that pattern, to a `term`, a mathematical model. A term is a text tone.

```
T E R M (tame eyes roar mind)
T R E E (tame roar eyes eyes)
T E X T (tame eyes keep seek text (recursive))
T O N E (tame oath need eyes)
T O A D (tame oath ache deed)
T E A R (tame eyes ache roar)
T A M E (this asks mind eyes)
```

Once you get down to all standard letters, you can transform to mathematical meaning, or the visual meaning. This is the relation between the text and the tile (sight), and text and term (math), and text and tone (sound). (math, sense?)

1776 - 247 - 247 =
1776 - 247 = 1529
1776 - 247 - 19 - 19 = 1491 = columbus last year of revolution. Discovery of americas.
(dividing by 19, to see loops of 19)
1985 - 19 = 1966 - (190 / 19 == 10) (MCMLXVI)
2004 - 19 = 1985 = 209 years (209/19 == 11)
2016 - 12 = 2004 = 228 years. I started college. (228 / 19 == 12)
2016 - 1776 = 240 years. Now.
2023 = 247 years. (247 / 19 == 13). This is 13 19 year cycles. So we are toward the last of the 12, and ready for 1 again. Start of the new year in 2023.

1. `day one`, `lite and dark`, opposites (sunday, after you wake up from 7th day, when you just meditate and gain wisdom. then on the start of a new week, the sun day, you open your eyes and can now make tons of new distinctions)
2. `day two`, now you make those tons of distinctions
3. `day three`: converge, find the best path in the distinctions ("Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear")
4. `day four`: time day, where you realize the stars, sun, and moon are actually moving, and so you can start to keep track of them!
5. `day five`: now you see your fingers and start to keep track! you are able to create tons of ideas now that you can keep track of the patterns mathematically (be fruitful and multiply)
6. `day six`: now you share your creation with the animals and plants (the world), and celebrate your creation (saturday)
7. `day seven`: rest (roar eyes seek test) (roll eyes seek text)

Figured it out by 7:04pm, why?

Google's design sprint mapping:

1. understand: days 7/1
2. diverge: day 2
3. converge (day 3/4)
4. prototype (day 5) (start counting the numbers, start implementing your new findings with your fingers, experiment with making something new (like tools!))
5. test/celebrate (day 6)
