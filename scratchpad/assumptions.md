The two foundational assumptions based on everyday experience are that _information exists_ and _computation_ exists. A simpler word for computation is _change_. There exists information and change. It seems that computation is a type of information, but this conjecture has not been thoroughly explored. If it was the case, then computation would arise from information. This is in line with the inflationary theory of the univese, where first space was created. In this interpretation, the creation of space is just the creation of units of computation.

This interpretation suggests that the universe is a set of computational units executing in parallel at the speed of light. If we take the volume of a computational unit to be the planck volume, and the size of the observable universe to be x light years, then the rough estimate of the number of computational units in the universe is >1^100.

This establishes the base state of computational evolution.

One outstanding question is how much information is associated with each computational unit? There seems to be at least 2 states, { 0, 1 }, or { on, off }, which would act like the bits. But then what about the information about the locally related computational units. Information about which surrounding computational units are relevant for computation might need to be stored, etc. And it might not be discrete. But let us assume that the values a computational unit can take are discrete.

In this sense, the universe acts like a cellular automaton.

Other unsolved question that arise include:

- Why are there many computational units instead of one?
- Can many computational units arise from one?
- How did the initial relations arise? That is, how did a distinction between none, one, and many arise? Is it possible for these relations to emerge out of something?

Once we assume there is a time step, discrete information values, and a large set of locally connected computational units, we can begin setting up a logical system.

But all of this is just information. It only becomes a structure when the information is recognizable by an intelligent agent. Intelligent agents are problem solving agents. Agents are information structures. There doesn't have to be intelligent agents, but information can only be called "structured" if it can be recognized, or represented. Representing literally means giving rise to the same thing (sorta).

So by definition, all structure of the universe is recognizable. But given that there is a set of computational units, and each unit contains information, and assuming each computation unit only holds a certain amount of information, there is a limit to information and structure somehow. This seems to mean there is a maximum amount of information structure that can occur in the universe, because there are recognizing agents and the thing to be recognized, you can't have all of both sorta thing?

A proof of correctness of any model, then, means it must be derived from the assumptions about the universe. That is, it must be possible within the constraints of computation, locality, and quantity of information.

All classical and non-classical logics can be derived from this. Since this interaction logic requires intelligent agents symbolically representing information, if you remove the element of interaction and only allow for intelligent symbolic manipulation, then you have classical logic. With computability logic, it has an element of intelligence baked into the evolutionary processes, and assumes it's a closed system, which are restrictions on the interaction/structure logic.

Maybe the inflationary period of the universe, where space was being created, is the computer being turned on. As if there is already a grid of transistors, and they are locally connected, and you have to start turning on from one point, but then they all turn on their neighbors, and they turn on their neighbors, etc. So that is the rapid creation of space / computational units. Logic gates sorta thing. And maybe they get turned on with initial data of some kind, like counting the number of neighbors that are already turned on. Then it would initialize the state of the cellular automaton.

The inflationary epoch lasted from {{ scale -36 }} seconds after the Big Bang to sometime between {{ scale -33 }} and {{ scale -32 }} seconds.

There is no "action at a distance", everything is local.
