> The space-cadet keyboard was equipped with seven modifier keys: four keys for bucky bits ("control", "meta", "super", and "hyper"), and three shift keys, called "shift", "top", and "front". Meta had been introduced on the earlier Knight keyboard, while Hyper and Super were introduced by this keyboard.[2] Each group was each in a row, thus allowing easy pressing of several modifier keys via chording; for example, Ctrl-Meta-Hyper-Super could be pressed with the fingers of one hand, while pressing another key with the other hand.
