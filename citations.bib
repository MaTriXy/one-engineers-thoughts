  abstract    = "Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience anxiety
                 and avoidance in face-to-face interactions. We performed a
                 meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
                 studies in SAD to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
                 neural underpinnings of face perception in this disorder. To
                 this purpose, we adopted an innovative approach, asking
                 authors for unpublished data. This is a common procedure for
                 behavioral meta-analyses, which, however has never been used
                 in neuroimaging studies. We searched Pubmed with the key words
                 ``Social Anxiety AND faces'' and ``Social Phobia AND faces.''
                 Then, we selected those fMRI studies for which we were able to
                 obtain data for the comparison between SAD and healthy
                 controls (HC) in a face perception task, either from the
                 published papers or from the authors themselves. In this way,
                 we obtained 23 studies (totaling 449 SAD and 424 HC
                 individuals). We identified significant clusters in which
                 faces evoked a higher response in SAD in bilateral amygdala,
                 globus pallidus, superior temporal sulcus, visual cortex, and
                 prefrontal cortex. We also found a higher activity for HC in
                 the lingual gyrus and in the posterior cingulate. Our findings
                 show that altered neural response to face in SAD is not
                 limited to emotional structures but involves a complex
                 network. These results may have implications for the
                 understanding of SAD pathophysiology, as they suggest that a
                 dysfunctional face perception process may bias patient
                 person-to-person interactions.",

  abstract    = "The capacity for self-regulation allows people to control
                 their thoughts, behaviors, emotions, and desires. In spite of
                 this impressive ability, failures of self-regulation are
                 common and contribute to numerous societal problems, from
                 obesity to drug addiction. Such failures frequently occur
                 following exposure to highly tempting cues, during negative
                 moods, or after self-regulatory resources have been depleted.
                 Here we review the available neuroscientific evidence
                 regarding self-regulation and its failures. At its core,
                 self-regulation involves a critical balance between the
                 strength of an impulse and an individual's ability to inhibit
                 the desired behavior. Although neuroimaging and patient
                 studies provide consistent evidence regarding the reward
                 aspects of impulses and desires, the neural mechanisms that
                 underlie the capacity for control have eluded consensus, with
                 various executive control regions implicated in different
                 studies. We outline the necessary properties for a
                 self-regulation control system and suggest that the use of
                 resting-state functional connectivity analyses may be useful
                 for understanding how people regulate their behavior and why

                 situations, the selfish motive to maximize own gains conflicts
                 with fairness preferences. In the present study we manipulated
                 the availability of cognitive-control resources for
                 ultimatum-game proposers to test whether preference for
                 fairness is a deliberative cognitive-controlled act or an
                 automatic act. In two experiments we found that a shortage of
                 cognitive control (ego depletion) led proposers in the
                 ultimatum game (UG) to propose significantly more equal split
                 offers than non-depleted proposers. These results can be
                 interpreted as resulting from an automatic concern for
                 fairness, or from a greater fear of rejection, which would be
                 in line with a purely self-interested response. To separate
                 these competing explanations, in Experiment 2 we conducted a
                 dictator-game in which the responder cannot reject the offer.
                 In contrast to the increased fairness behavior demonstrated by
                 depleted ultimatum-game proposers, we found that depleted
                 dictator-game allocators chose the equal split significantly
                 less often than non-depleted allocators. These results
                 indicate that fairness preferences are automatically driven
                 among UG proposers. The automatic fair behavior, however, at
                 least partially reflects concern about self-interest gain. We
                 discuss different explanations for these results.",

                 can reduce the impact of temptations on cognition and behavior

                 hampers self-regulation. Participants performed different
                 speeded categorization tasks with pictures of attractive and
                 neutral food items (Studies 1-3) and attractive and
                 unattractive female faces (Study 4), while we assessed their
                 reaction times as an indicator of selective attention (Studies
                 1, 3, and 4) or as an indicator of hedonic thoughts about food
                 (Study 2). Cognitive load was manipulated by a concurrent
                 digit span task. Results show that participants displayed
                 greater attention to tempting stimuli (Studies 1, 3, and 4)
                 and activated hedonic thoughts in response to palatable food
                 (Study 2), but high cognitive load completely eliminated these
                 effects. Moreover, cognitive load during the exposure to
                 attractive food reduced food cravings (Study 1) and increased
                 healthy food choices (Study 3). Finally, individual
                 differences in sensitivity to food temptations (Study 3) and
                 interest in alternative relationship partners (Study 4)
                 predicted selective attention to attractive stimuli, but
                 again, only when cognitive load was low. Our findings suggest
                 that recognizing the tempting value of attractive stimuli in
                 our living environment requires cognitive resources. This has
                 the important implication that, contrary to traditional views,
                 performing a concurrent demanding task may actually diminish
                 the captivating power of temptation and thus facilitate

                 own gains. In this study, we examined the role of cognitive
                 control in reciprocal behavior to determine whether it is a
                 deliberate and controlled act or whether the behavior is
                 evoked automatically. In Experiment 1, depletion of cognitive
                 control resources increased the rate of rejected unfair offers
                 in the ultimatum game despite associated financial loss. In
                 Experiments 2A and 2B, using 2 depletion manipulations, we

                 Currently, there are two empirical research disciplines
                 tackling human volition: cognitive neuroscience and social

                 with impairments in facial emotion perception and Theory of
                 Mind (ToM). These social cognitive skills deficits may be
                 related to a reduced capacity to effectively regulate one's
                 own emotions according to the social context. We therefore set
                 out to examine the relationship between social cognitive
                 abilities and the use of cognitive strategies for regulating
                 negative emotion in SZ and BD. Participants were 56 SZ, 33 BD,
                 and 58 healthy controls (HC) who completed the Ekman 60-faces
                 test of facial emotion recognition; a sub-set of these
                 participants also completed The Awareness of Social Inference
                 Test (TASIT) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation
                 Questionnaire (CERQ). SZ participants demonstrated impairments
                 in emotion perception on both the Ekman and the TASIT Emotion
                 Evaluation tests relative to BD and HC. While both SZ and BD
                 patients showed ToM deficits (i.e., perception of sarcasm and
                 lie) compared to HC, SZ patients demonstrated significantly
                 greater ToM impairment compared to BD. There were also
                 distinct patterns of cognitive strategies used to regulate
                 emotion in both patient groups: those with SZ were more likely
                 to engage in catastrophizing and rumination, while BD subjects
                 were more likely to blame themselves and were less likely to
                 engage in positive reappraisal, relative to HC. In addition,
                 those with SZ were more likely to blame others compared to BD.
                 Associations between social cognition and affect regulation
                 were revealed for HC only: TASIT performance was negatively
                 associated with more frequent use of rumination,
                 catastrophizing, and blaming others, such that more frequent
                 use of maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies was
                 associated with poor social cognitive performance. These
                 associations were not present in either patient group.
                 However, both SZ and BD patients demonstrated poor ToM
                 performance and aberrant use of emotion regulation strategies
                 consistent with previous studies. SZ also showed basic emotion
                 recognition deficits relative to BD and HC. That there were no
                 associations between social cognition and the capacity to
                 self-regulate negative emotion in SZ and BD (in the context of
                 poor social cognition and maladaptive regulatory strategies)
                 suggests that dysfunction in fronto-limbic brain networks may

  abstract    = "Perceiving and evaluating intentional harms in an
                 interpersonal context engages both cognitive and emotional
                 domains. This process involves inference of intentions, moral
                 judgment, and, crucially, empathy towards others' suffering.
                 This latter skill is notably impaired in behavioral variant
                 frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). However, the relationship
                 between regional brain atrophy in bvFTD and deficits in the
                 above-mentioned abilities is not well understood. The present
                 study investigated how gray matter (GM) atrophy in bvFTD
                 patients correlates with the perception and evaluation of
                 harmful actions (attribution of intentionality, evaluation of
                 harmful behavior, empathic concern, and moral judgment).
                 First, we compared the behavioral performance of 26 bvFTD
                 patients and 23 healthy controls on an experimental task (ET)
                 indexing intentionality, empathy, and moral cognition during
                 evaluation of harmful actions. Second, we compared GM volume
                 in patients and controls using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).
                 Third, we examined brain regions where atrophy might be
                 associated with specific impairments in the patient group.
                 Finally, we explored whether the patients' deficits in
                 intentionality comprehension and empathic concern could be
                 partially explained by regional GM atrophy or impairments in
                 other relevant factors, such as executive functions (EFs). In
                 bvFTD patients, atrophy of limbic structures (amygdala and
                 anterior paracingulate cortex - APC) was related to
                 impairments in intentionality comprehension, while atrophy of
                 the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was associated with empathic
                 concern deficits. Intentionality comprehension impairments
                 were predicted by EFs and orbitofrontal atrophy predicted
                 deficits in empathic concern. Thus, although the perception
                 and evaluation of harmful actions are variously compromised in
                 bvFTD, deficits in empathic concern may be central to this
                 syndrome as they are associated with one of the earliest
                 atrophied region. More generally, our results shed light on
                 social cognition deficits in bvFTD and may have important
                 clinical implications.",

  abstract    = "Recent years have witnessed the emergence of powerful new
                 tools for assaying the brain and a remarkable acceleration of
                 research focused on the interplay of emotion and cognition.
                 This work has begun to yield new insights into fundamental
                 questions about the nature of the mind and important clues
                 about the origins of mental illness. In particular, this
                 research demonstrates that stress, anxiety, and other kinds of
                 emotion can profoundly influence key elements of cognition,
                 including selective attention, working memory, and cognitive
                 control. Often, this influence persists beyond the duration of
                 transient emotional challenges, partially reflecting the
                 slower molecular dynamics of catecholamine and hormonal
                 neurochemistry. In turn, circuits involved in attention,
                 executive control, and working memory contribute to the
                 regulation of emotion. The distinction between the 'emotional'
                 and the 'cognitive' brain is fuzzy and context-dependent.
                 Indeed, there is compelling evidence that brain territories
                 and psychological processes commonly associated with
                 cognition, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
                 working memory, play a central role in emotion. Furthermore,
                 putatively emotional and cognitive regions influence one
                 another via a complex web of connections in ways that jointly
                 contribute to adaptive and maladaptive behavior. This work
                 demonstrates that emotion and cognition are deeply interwoven
                 in the fabric of the brain, suggesting that widely held
                 beliefs about the key constituents of 'the emotional brain'
                 and 'the cognitive brain' are fundamentally flawed. We
                 conclude by outlining several strategies for enhancing future
                 research. Developing a deeper understanding of the
                 emotional-cognitive brain is important, not just for
                 understanding the mind but also for elucidating the root
                 causes of its disorders.",

                 However, beyond simple measures of population and economic
                 power, there has been no rigorous quantitative way to define
                 the global influence of languages. Here we use the structure

                 economic or demographic measures. We find that the structure
                 of these three global language networks (GLNs) is centered on
                 English as a global hub and around a handful of intermediate
                 hub languages, which include Spanish, German, French, Russian,
                 Portuguese, and Chinese. We validate the measure of a
                 language's centrality in the three GLNs by showing that it
                 exhibits a strong correlation with two independent measures of
                 the number of famous people born in the countries associated
                 with that language. These results suggest that the position of
                 a language in the GLN contributes to the visibility of its

  abstract      = "The Koch snowflake is one of the first fractals that were
                   mathematically described. It is interesting because it has
                   an infinite perimeter in the limit but its limit area is
                   finite. In this paper, a recently proposed computational
                   methodology allowing one to execute numerical computations
                   with infinities and infinitesimals is applied to study the
                   Koch snowflake at infinity. Numerical computations with
                   actual infinite and infinitesimal numbers can be executed on
                   the Infinity Computer being a new supercomputer patented in
                   USA and EU. It is revealed in the paper that at infinity the
                   snowflake is not unique, i.e., different snowflakes can be
                   distinguished for different infinite numbers of steps
                   executed during the process of their generation. It is then
                   shown that for any given infinite number~$n$ of steps it
                   becomes possible to calculate the exact infinite number,
                   $N_n$, of sides of the snowflake, the exact infinitesimal
                   length, $L_n$, of each side and the exact infinite
                   perimeter, $P_n$, of the Koch snowflake as the result of
                   multiplication of the infinite $N_n$ by the infinitesimal
                   $L_n$. It is established that for different infinite $n$ and
                   $k$ the infinite perimeters $P_n$ and $P_k$ are also
                   different and the difference can be infinite. It is shown
                   that the finite areas $A_n$ and $A_k$ of the snowflakes can
                   be also calculated exactly (up to infinitesimals) for
                   different infinite $n$ and $k$ and the difference $A_n -
                   A_k$ results to be infinitesimal. Finally, snowflakes
                   constructed starting from different initial conditions are
                   also studied and their quantitative characteristics at

                   the application to the classical case of the pentagrid, i.e.
                   the tiling of the hyperbolic plane which is generated by
                   reflections of the regular rectangular pentagon in its sides

                 dynamics of the footprint makers, including estimates of
                 speed, sex and group composition. Generally such estimates are
                 made by comparing footprint evidence with modern controls;
                 however, previous studies have not accounted for the variation
                 in footprint dimensions coming from load bearing activities.
                 It is likely that a portion of the hominins who created these
                 fossil footprints were carrying a significant load, such as
                 offspring or foraging loads, which caused variation in the
                 footprint which could extend to variation in any estimations
                 concerning the footprint's maker. To identify significant
                 variation in footprints due to load-bearing tasks, we had
                 participants (N = 30, 15 males and 15 females) walk at a
                 series of speeds carrying a 20kg pack on their back, side and
                 front. Paint was applied to the bare feet of each participant
                 to create footprints that were compared in terms of foot
                 length, foot width and foot area. Female foot length and width
                 increased during multiple loaded conditions. An appreciation
                 of footprint variability associated with carrying loads adds
                 an additional layer to our understanding of the behavior and
                 morphology of extinct hominin populations.",

                 Four experiments examined chimpanzee facial expression
                 processing using a set of standardized, prototypical stimuli
                 created using the new ChimpFACS coding system. First,

                 these expressions using a computerized matching-to-sample
                 task, and recognition was impaired for all but one expression
                 category when they were inverted. Third, a multidimensional
                 scaling analysis examined the perceived dissimilarity among
                 these facial expressions revealing 2 main dimensions, the
                 degree of mouth closure and extent of lip-puckering and
                 retraction. Finally, subjects were asked to match each facial
                 expression category using only individual component features.
                 For each expression category, at least 1 component movement
                 was more salient or representative of that expression than the

                 the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here
                 we report the findings of a somewhat unconventional
                 investigation of emotional speech. Instead of looking for
                 direct acoustic correlates of multiple emotions, we tested a
                 specific theory, the size code hypothesis of emotional speech,
                 about two emotions--anger and happiness. According to the
                 hypothesis, anger and happiness are conveyed in speech by
                 exaggerating or understating the body size of the speaker. In
                 two studies consisting of six experiments, we synthesized
                 vowels with a three-dimensional articulatory synthesizer with
                 parameter manipulations derived from the size code hypothesis,
                 and asked Thai listeners to judge the body size and emotion of
                 the speaker. Vowels synthesized with a longer vocal tract and
                 lower F(0) were mostly heard as from a larger person if the
                 length and F(0) differences were stationary, but from an angry
                 person if the vocal tract was dynamically lengthened and F(0)
                 was dynamically lowered. The opposite was true for the
                 perception of small body size and happiness. These results
                 provide preliminary support for the size code hypothesis. They

                 produce elaborate patterns of structurally organized
                 vocalizations, whereas many other vertebrates such as
                 non-human primates and most other bird groups either cannot or
                 do so to a very limited degree. To explain the similarities
                 among humans and vocal-learning birds and the differences with
                 other species, various theories have been proposed. One set of
                 theories are motor theories, which underscore the role of the
                 motor system as an evolutionary substrate for vocal production
                 learning. For instance, the motor theory of speech and song
                 perception proposes enhanced auditory perceptual learning of
                 speech in humans and song in birds, which suggests a
                 considerable level of neurobiological specialization. Another,
                 a motor theory of vocal learning origin, proposes that the
                 brain pathways that control the learning and production of
                 song and speech were derived from adjacent motor brain
                 pathways. Another set of theories are cognitive theories,
                 which address the interface between cognition and the
                 auditory-vocal domains to support language learning in humans.
                 Here we critically review the behavioral and neurobiological
                 evidence for parallels and differences between the so-called
                 vocal learners and vocal non-learners in the context of motor
                 and cognitive theories. In doing so, we note that behaviorally
                 vocal-production learning abilities are more distributed than
                 categorical, as are the auditory-learning abilities of
                 animals. We propose testable hypotheses on the extent of the
                 specializations and cross-species correspondences suggested by
                 motor and cognitive theories. We believe that determining how
                 spoken language evolved is likely to become clearer with
                 concerted efforts in testing comparative data from many
                 non-human animal species.",

                 control and gestures, and the other that emphasizes
                 auditory-vocal mechanisms. The capacity for language is based
                 on relatively well defined neural substrates whose rudiments
                 have been traced in the non-human primate brain. At its core,
                 this circuit constitutes an auditory-vocal sensorimotor
                 circuit with two main components, a ``ventral pathway''
                 connecting anterior auditory regions with anterior
                 ventrolateral prefrontal areas, and a ``dorsal pathway''
                 connecting auditory areas with parietal areas and with
                 posterior ventrolateral prefrontal areas via the arcuate
                 fasciculus and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. In
                 humans, the dorsal circuit is especially important for
                 phonological processing and phonological working memory,
                 capacities that are critical for language acquisition and for
                 complex syntax processing. In the macaque, the homolog of the
                 dorsal circuit overlaps with an inferior parietal-premotor
                 network for hand and gesture selection that is under voluntary
                 control, while vocalizations are largely fixed and
                 involuntary. The recruitment of the dorsal component for
                 vocalization behavior in the human lineage, together with a
                 direct cortical control of the subcortical vocalizing system,
                 are proposed to represent a fundamental innovation in human
                 evolution, generating an inflection point that permitted the
                 explosion of vocal language and human communication. In this
                 context, vocal communication and gesturing have a common

                 viewers, but whether this is driven by perceptual or
                 linguistic mechanisms is debated. We report an investigation

            realistic sounds from physical models of the geometry and mate-
            rial properties of objects. The cognitive importance of realistic
            sounds is well known in the entertainment industry where sampled
            sound effects are added to enhance realism. As simula- tions become
            more interactive---for instance, in large architectural
            walkthroughs (Airey, Rohlf, and F. P. Brooks, 1990) and virtual
            reality---synthesizing realistic object sounds directly from
            physical models and render- ing them in real time will be
            increasingly important. The generation of sounds can be
            characterized as shown in Figure 1, which depicts the process as a
            pipe- line similar to the sound-rendering pipeline of Takala and
            Hahn (1992). While this is a simplification, it indi- cates the
            major computational tasks in going from a col- lision event to the
            sound heard by a human ear. The fo- cus of this paper is the
            initial stage of this pipeline: the computation of the sounds
            produced by vibrations of the object, which depend on the geometry
            of the object, its material properties, and the characteristics of
            the im- pact. For completeness we also briefly describe other parts
            of the pipeline such as impact dynamics and envi- ronment modeling",

                 Thereby, perceivers are more accurate at discriminating
                 between stimuli of different categories than between stimuli
                 within the same category (Harnad, 1987; Goldstone, 1994). The
                 current experiments investigated whether the structural
                 information in the face is sufficient for CP to occur.
                 Alternatively, a perceiver's conceptual knowledge, by virtue
                 of expertise or verbal labeling, might contribute. In two
                 experiments, people who differed in their conceptual knowledge

                 perceivers first explicitly learned facial expression
                 categories with a label were they more likely to show CP.
                 Overall, the results suggest that the structural information

                 METHOD: Younger (6-11 years) and older (12-18 years)
                 hearing-impaired children (HI; n = 49), vision-impaired
                 children (VI; n = 42), and children with no sensory impairment
                 (NSI; n = 72) were assessed with the Emotion Recognition
                 Scales (ERS), which include two tests of the ability to
                 recognize vocal expressions of emotion, two tests of the
                 ability to recognize facial expressions of emotion, and three
                 tests of emotion understanding. RESULTS: Results indicate that
                 when compared with age-peers, HI children and adolescents have
                 significant delays or deficits on all ERS, but VI children and
                 adolescents are delayed only on emotion recognition tasks.
                 When compared with children group-matched for verbal ability
                 (Wechsler verbal scales), the achievement of HI children on
                 ERS equals or exceeds that of controls; VI children
                 underachieve on an emotion recognition task and overachieve on
                 an emotion vocabulary task compared to verbal ability matched
                 peers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that VI children have a
                 specific emotion recognition deficit, but among HI children,
                 performance on emotion recognition and emotion understanding
                 tasks reflects delayed acquisition of a broad range of

                 would dictate. The ``Frame then Content'' (F/C) hypothesis
                 (Davis \& MacNeilage, 1994) attributes this pattern to
                 biomechanical vocal-tract biases that change as infants

                 1989) attributes preferences to demands placed on shared
                 articulators. F/C implies that preferences will diminish as

                 MacNeilage and Davis, who found the evidence compatible with

                 studied. METHOD: Thirty-seven American English speakers
                 participated in a perceptual categorization experiment. For
                 the experiment, an articulatory-to-acoustic model was used to
                 synthesize 342 five-formant vowels, covering maximal vowel
                 spaces for speakers at 5 growth stages (from 6 months old to
                 adult). RESULTS: Results indicate that the 3 vowels /i u ae/
                 can be correctly perceived by adult listeners when produced by
                 speakers with a 6-month-old vocal tract.
                 Articulatory-to-acoustic relationships for these 3 vowels
                 differ across growth stages. For a given perceived vowel
                 category, the infant's tongue position is more fronted than
                 the adult's. Furthermore, nonuniform vocal tract growth
                 influences degree of interarticulator coupling for a given
                 perceived vowel, leading to a reduced correlation between jaw
                 height and tongue body position in infantlike compared with
                 adult vocal tracts. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that
                 nonuniform vocal tract growth does not prevent the speaker
                 from producing acoustic-auditory targets related to American
                 English vowels. However, the relationships between
                 articulatory configurations and perceptual targets change from
                 birth to adulthood.",

  author   = "Semaw, Sileshi",
  abstract = "The systematic archaeological and geological survey and
              excavations at Gona between 1992--1994 led to the discovery of
              well-flaked stone artefacts which are currently the oldest known
              from anywhere in the world. More than 3000 surface and excavated
              artefacts were recovered at 15 localities documented east and
              west of the Kada Gona river. Based on radioisotopic dating
              (40Ar/39Ar) and magnetostratigraphy, the artefacts are dated
              between 2·6--2·5 million years ago (Ma). EG10 and EG12 from East
              Gona are the most informative with the highest density, providing
              the best opportunity for characterizing the oldest assemblages
              and for understanding the stone working capability of the
              earliest tool makers. Slightly younger artefact occurrences dated
              to 2·4--2·3 Ma are known from Hadar and Omo in Ethiopia, and from
              Lokalalei in Kenya. Cut-marked bones dated to 2·5 Ma from Bouri
              in Ethiopia are now providing important clues on the function of
              these artefacts. In addition, Australopithecus garhi known from
              contemporary deposits at Bouri may be the best candidate
              responsible for the oldest artefacts. Surprisingly, the makers of
              the Gona artefacts had a sophisticated understanding of stone
              fracture mechanics and control similar to what is observed for
              Oldowan assemblages dated between 2·0--1·5 Ma. This observation
              was corroborated by the recent archaeological discoveries made at
              Lokalalei. Because of the similarities seen in the techniques of
              artefact manufacture during the Late Pliocene--Early Pleistocene,
              it is argued here that the stone assemblages dated between
              2·6--1·5 Ma group into the Oldowan Industry. The similarity and
              simplicity of the artefacts from this time interval suggests a
              technological stasis in the Oldowan.",

                   the application to the classical case of the pentagrid, i.e.
                   the tiling of the hyperbolic plane which is generated by
                   reflections of the regular rectangular pentagon in its sides
                   and, recursively, of its images in their sides. From this

                 biological data and data analysis. Many of these data sets
                 represent only a small fraction of the system's behavior,
                 making the visualization of full system behavior difficult. A
                 more complete understanding of a biological system is gained
                 when different types of data (and/or conclusions drawn from
                 the data) are integrated into a larger-scale representation or
                 model of the system. Ideally, this type of model is consistent
                 with all available data about the system, and it is then used
                 to generate additional hypotheses to be tested. Computer-based
                 methods intended to formulate models that integrate various
                 events and to test the consistency of these models with
                 respect to the laboratory-based observations on which they are
                 based are potentially very useful. In addition, in contrast to
                 informal models, the consistency of such formal computer-based
                 models with laboratory data can be tested rigorously by
                 methods of formal verification. We combined two formal
                 modeling approaches in computer science that were originally
                 developed for non-biological system design. One is the
                 inter-object approach using the language of live sequence
                 charts (LSCs) with the Play-Engine tool, and the other is the
                 intra-object approach using the language of statecharts and
                 Rhapsody as the tool. Integration is carried out using
                 InterPlay, a simulation engine coordinator. Using these tools,
                 we constructed a combined model comprising three modules. One
                 module represents the early lineage of the somatic gonad of C.
                 elegans in LSCs, while a second more detailed module in
                 statecharts represents an interaction between two cells within
                 this lineage that determine their developmental outcome. Using
                 the advantages of the tools, we created a third module
                 representing a set of key experimental data using LSCs. We
                 tested the combined statechart-LSC model by showing that the
                 simulations were consistent with the set of experimental LSCs.
                 This small-scale modular example demonstrates the potential
                 for using similar approaches for verification by exhaustive
                 testing of models by LSCs. It also shows the advantages of

                 pattern of six cells is determined by the competition of the
                 LET-23 and the Notch signalling pathways. Modelling cell fate
                 determination in vulval development using state-based models,
                 coupled with formal analysis techniques, has been established
                 as a powerful approach in predicting the outcome of
                 combinations of mutations. However, computing the outcomes of
                 complex and highly concurrent models can become prohibitive.
                 Here, we show how logic programs derived from state machines

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Visualisation of neurons labeled with fluorescent
                 proteins or compounds generally require exposure to intense
                 light for a relatively long period of time, often leading to
                 bleaching of the fluorescent probe and photodamage of the
                 tissue. Here we created a technique to drastically shorten
                 light exposure and improve the targeting of fluorescent
                 labeled cells that is specially useful for patch-clamp
                 recordings. We applied image tracking and mask overlay to
                 reduce the time of fluorescence exposure and minimise mistakes
                 when identifying neurons. METHODS: Neurons are first
                 identified according to visual criteria (e.g. fluorescence
                 protein expression, shape, viability etc.) and a transmission
                 microscopy image Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) or
                 Dodt contrast containing the cell used as a reference for the
                 tracking algorithm. A fluorescence image can also be acquired
                 later to be used as a mask (that can be overlaid on the target
                 during live transmission video). As patch-clamp experiments
                 require translating the microscope stage, we used pattern
                 matching to track reference neurons in order to move the
                 fluorescence mask to match the new position of the objective
                 in relation to the sample. For the image processing we used
                 the Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) library, including
                 the Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) for tracking cells. The
                 dataset of images (n = 720) was analyzed under normal
                 conditions of acquisition and with influence of noise
                 (defocusing and brightness). RESULTS: We validated the method
                 in dissociated neuronal cultures and fresh brain slices
                 expressing Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (eYFP) or
                 Tandem Dimer Tomato (tdTomato) proteins, which considerably
                 decreased the exposure to fluorescence excitation, thereby
                 minimising photodamage. We also show that the neuron tracking
                 can be used in differential interference contrast or Dodt
                 contrast microscopy. CONCLUSION: The techniques of digital
                 image processing used in this work are an important addition
                 to the set of microscopy tools used in modern
                 electrophysiology, specially in experiments with neuron

  abstract    = "Anatomically modern hunter-gatherers expanded from Africa into
                 Southeast Asia at least 50,000 years ago, where they probably
                 encountered and interacted with populations of Homo erectus
                 and Homo floresiensis and the recently discovered Denisovans.
                 Simulation studies suggest that these hunter-gatherers may
                 well have followed a coastal route that ultimately led to the
                 settlement of Sahul, while archaeology confirms that they also
                 crossed significant seas and explored well into the interior.
                 They also adapted to marked environmental changes that
                 alternated between relatively cool and dry conditions and
                 warmer, wetter interludes. During the former, the sea fell by
                 up to 120 m below its present level, which opened up a vast
                 low-lying area known as Sundaland. Three principal alignments
                 can be identified: the first involved the occupation of rock
                 shelters in upland regions, the second has identified
                 settlement on broad riverine floodplains, and the last
                 concentrated on the raised beaches formed from about five
                 millennia ago when the sea level was elevated above its
                 present position. This cultural sequence was dislocated about
                 4 kya when rice and millet farmers infiltrated the lowlands of
                 Southeast Asia ultimately from the Yangtze River valley. It is
                 suggested that this led to two forms of interaction. In the
                 first, the indigenous hunter-gatherers integrated with
                 intrusive Neolithic communities and, while losing their
                 cultural identity, contributed their genes to the present
                 population of Southeast Asia. In the second, hunter-gatherers
                 withdrew to rainforest refugia and, through selective
                 pressures inherent in such an environment, survived as the
                 small-bodied, dark-skinned humans found to this day in the
                 Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand, and the Andaman
                 Islands. Beyond the impact of expansive rice farmers in
                 Melanesia and Australia, hunter-gatherers continued to
                 dominate until they encountered European settlement.",

                 considered by many early anthropologists to be pristine
                 examples of a ``negrito'' substrate of humanity that existed
                 throughout Southeast Asia. Despite over 150 years of research
                 and study, questions over the extent of shared ancestry
                 between Andaman Islanders and other small-bodied, gracile,
                 dark-skinned populations throughout the region are still
                 unresolved. This shared phenotype could be a product of shared
                 history, evolutionary convergence, or a mixture of both.
                 Recent population genetic studies have tended to emphasize
                 long-term physical isolation of the Andaman Islanders and an
                 affinity to ancestral populations of South Asia. We reexamine
                 the genetic evidence from genome-wide autosomal
                 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for a shared history

  abstract    = "The so-called negritos adapt not just to a tropical forest
                 environment but also to an environment characterized by
                 perturbations and fluctuations. As with other hunter-gatherers
                 in the region and, indeed, throughout the world, they use both
                 social and ecological methods to enhance their chances of
                 survival in this changing environment: socially, they have
                 developed networks of trading and marriage partners;
                 ecologically, they maintain patches of key resources that are
                 available for future harvesting. As evidenced in the case of
                 the Batek (Orang Asli), patterns of forest structure and
                 composition are sometimes direct outcomes of intentional
                 resource concentration and enrichment strategies. While little
                 of the above is controversial anthropologically, what has
                 drawn some debate is the nature of the relationship with
                 partner societies. Conventional wisdom posits relations of
                 inequality between foragers and ``others'': foragers and
                 farmers are often construed as hierarchical dyads where
                 foragers supply products or labor to farmers in exchange for
                 agricultural harvests and other trade goods. This kind of
                 adaptation appears to be one of divergent specialization.
                 However, there are cases, such as in the relationship between
                 Batek and Semaq Beri, where both societies follow a roughly
                 similar mode of adaptation, and specialization has not
                 materialized. In sum, while not denying that hierarchy and
                 inequality exist, I suggest that they have to be
                 contextualized within a larger strand of relationships that
                 includes both hierarchy and egality. Further, such
                 relationships are part of the general portfolio of risk
                 reduction strategies, following which access to widely
                 scattered environmental resources, and passage from one
                 location to another, is enhanced not by competing with and
                 displacing neighbors but by maintaining a flexible regime of
                 friendly exchange partners.",

  abstract    = "We generated genome-wide data from 69 Europeans who lived
                 between 8,000-3,000 years ago by enriching ancient DNA
                 libraries for a target set of almost 400,000 polymorphisms.
                 Enrichment of these positions decreases the sequencing
                 required for genome-wide ancient DNA analysis by a median of
                 around 250-fold, allowing us to study an order of magnitude
                 more individuals than previous studies and to obtain new
                 insights about the past. We show that the populations of
                 Western and Far Eastern Europe followed opposite trajectories
                 between 8,000-5,000 years ago. At the beginning of the
                 Neolithic period in Europe, ∼8,000-7,000 years ago, closely
                 related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary
                 and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas
                 Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of
                 hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ∼24,000-year-old
                 Siberian. By ∼6,000-5,000 years ago, farmers throughout much
                 of Europe had more hunter-gatherer ancestry than their
                 predecessors, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of
                 this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern
                 European hunter-gatherers, but also from a population of Near
                 Eastern ancestry. Western and Eastern Europe came into contact
                 ∼4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded Ware people
                 from Germany traced ∼75\% of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,
                 documenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe
                 from its eastern periphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in
                 all sampled central Europeans until at least ∼3,000 years ago,
                 and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans. These results
                 provide support for a steppe origin of at least some of the
                 Indo-European languages of Europe.",

  abstract      = "Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments
                   in eukaryotic. The actin filaments play roles of
                   cytoskeleton, motility units , information processing and
                   learning. We model actin filament as a double chain of
                   finite state machines, nodes, which take states `0' and `1'.
                   The states are abstractions of absence and presence of a
                   sub-threshold charge on an actin units corresponding to the
                   nodes. All nodes update their state in parallel in discrete
                   time. A node updates its current state depending on states
                   of two closest neighbours in the node chain and two closest
                   neighbours in the complementary chain. Previous models of
                   actin automata considered momentary state transitions of
                   nodes. We enrich the actin automata model by assuming that
                   states of nodes depends not only on the current states of
                   neighbouring node but also on their past states. Thus, we
                   assess the effect of memory of past states on the dynamics
                   of acting automata. We demonstrate in computational
                   experiments that memory slows down propagation of
                   perturbations, decrease entropy of space-time patterns
                   generated, transforms travelling localisations to stationary
                   oscillators, and stationary oscillations to still patterns.",

                 explores the roles of simplicity and probability in evaluating
                 competing causal explanations. Four experiments investigate
                 the hypothesis that simpler explanations are judged both
                 better and more likely to be true. In all experiments,
                 simplicity is quantified as the number of causes invoked in an
                 explanation, with fewer causes corresponding to a simpler
                 explanation. Experiment 1 confirms that all else being equal,
                 both simpler and more probable explanations are preferred.
                 Experiments 2 and 3 examine how explanations are evaluated
                 when simplicity and probability compete. The data suggest that
                 simpler explanations are assigned a higher prior probability,
                 with the consequence that disproportionate probabilistic
                 evidence is required before a complex explanation will be
                 favored over a simpler alternative. Moreover, committing to a
                 simple but unlikely explanation can lead to systematic
                 overestimation of the prevalence of the cause invoked in the
                 simple explanation. Finally, Experiment 4 finds that the
                 preference for simpler explanations can be overcome when
                 probability information unambiguously supports a complex
                 explanation over a simpler alternative. Collectively, these
                 findings suggest that simplicity is used as a basis for
                 evaluating explanations and for assigning prior probabilities
                 when unambiguous probability information is absent. More
                 broadly, evaluating explanations may operate as a mechanism
                 for generating estimates of subjective probability.",

                 computational problems posed by the environment, assuming that
                 people are capable of optimally solving those problems. This
                 differs from more traditional formal models of cognition,
                 which focus on the psychological processes responsible for
                 behavior. A basic challenge for rational models is thus
                 explaining how optimal solutions can be approximated by
                 psychological processes. We outline a general strategy for
                 answering this question, namely to explore the psychological
                 plausibility of approximation algorithms developed in computer
                 science and statistics. In particular, we argue that Monte
                 Carlo methods provide a source of rational process models that
                 connect optimal solutions to psychological processes. We
                 support this argument through a detailed example, applying
                 this approach to Anderson's (1990, 1991) rational model of
                 categorization (RMC), which involves a particularly
                 challenging computational problem. Drawing on a connection
                 between the RMC and ideas from nonparametric Bayesian
                 statistics, we propose 2 alternative algorithms for
                 approximate inference in this model. The algorithms we
                 consider include Gibbs sampling, a procedure appropriate when
                 all stimuli are presented simultaneously, and particle
                 filters, which sequentially approximate the posterior
                 distribution with a small number of samples that are updated
                 as new data become available. Applying these algorithms to
                 several existing datasets shows that a particle filter with a

                 observed events, omitting the representation of the distal
                 relations. By incorporating bayesian inference over
                 distributions of causal strength and causal structures, along
                 with noisy-logical (i.e., causal) functions for integrating
                 the influences of multiple causes on a single effect, human
                 judgments about causal strength and structure can be predicted
                 accurately for relatively simple causal structures. Dynamic
                 models of learning based on the causal framework can explain
                 patterns of acquisition observed with serial presentation of
                 contingency data and are consistent with available
                 neuroimaging data. The approach has been extended to a diverse
                 range of inductive tasks, including category-based and

              of patterns and regularities from data. This paper investigates
              the structure of patterns in data defined over discrete features,
              i.e. features with two or more qualitatively distinct values. Any
              such pattern can be algebraically decomposed into a spectrum of
              component patterns, each of which is a simpler or more atomic
              ``regularity.'' Each component regularity involves a certain
              number of features, referred to as its degree. Regularities of
              lower degree represent simpler or more coarse patterns in the
              original pattern, while regularities of higher degree represent
              finer or more idiosyncratic patterns. The full spectral breakdown
              of a pattern into component regularities of minimal degree,
              referred to as its power series, expresses the original pattern
              in terms of the regular rules or patterns it obeys, amounting to
              a kind of ``theory'' of the pattern. The number of regularities
              at various degrees necessary to represent the pattern is
              tabulated in its power spectrum, which expresses how much of a
              pattern's structure can be explained by regularities of various
              levels of complexity. A weighted mean of the pattern's spectral
              power gives a useful numeric summary of its overall complexity,
              called its algebraic complexity. The basic theory of algebraic
              decomposition is extended in several ways, including algebraic
              accounts of the typicality of individual objects within concepts,
              and estimation of the power series from noisy data. Finally some

              deals with the problem of retrieving those models in the

              fragment thereof. Up to now, there is a notable research gap on
              comparing different approaches to this problem and on evaluating
              them in the same setting. Therefore, this paper presents three
              similarity metrics that can be used to answer queries on process
              repositories: (i) node matching similarity that compares the
              labels and attributes attached to process model elements; (ii)
              structural similarity that compares element labels as well as the
              topology of process models; and (iii) behavioral similarity that
              compares element labels as well as causal relations captured in
              the process model. These metrics are experimentally evaluated in
              terms of precision and recall. The results show that all three
              metrics yield comparable results, with structural similarity
              slightly outperforming the other two metrics. Also, all three

  abstract  = "The Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) is a standard for
               capturing business processes in the early phases of system
               development. The mix of constructs in BPMN makes it possible to
               define models with a range of semantic errors. But the static
               analysis of BPMN models to detect such errors is hindered by
               ambiguities in the standard specification and the complexity of
               the language. The fact that BPMN integrates constructs from
               graph-oriented process definition languages with features for
               concurrent execution of multiple instances of a subprocess and
               exception handling, makes it challenging to provide a formal
               semantics of BPMN. Even more challenging is to provide a
               semantics that can be used to analyse BPMN models. This paper
               proposes a formalisation of BPMN in terms a mapping to Petri
               nets, for which efficient analysis techniques exist. The mapping
               has been implemented as a tool that generates code in the Petri

  abstract = "Context Large organizations often run hundreds or even thousands
              of different business processes. Managing such large collections
              of business process models is a challenging task. Software can
              assist in performing that task, by supporting common management
              functions such as storage, search and version management of
              models. It can also provide advanced functions that are specific
              for managing collections of process models, such as managing the
              consistency of public and private processes. Software that
              supports the management of large collections of business process
              models is called: business process model repository software.
              Objective This paper contributes to the development of business
              process model repositories, by analyzing the state of the art.
              Method To perform the analysis a literature survey and a
              comparison of existing (business process model) repository
              technology is performed. Result The results of the state of the
              art analysis are twofold. First, a framework for business process
              model repositories is presented, which consists of a management
              model and a reference architecture. The management model lists
              the functionality that can be provided and the reference
              architecture presents the components that provide that
              functionality. Second, an analysis is presented of the extent to
              which existing business process model repositories implement the
              functionality from the framework. Conclusion The results
              presented in the paper are valuable as a comprehensive overview
              of business process model repository functionality. In addition
              they form a basis for a future research agenda. We conclude that
              existing repositories focus on traditional functionality rather
              than exploiting the full potential of information management
              tools, thus we show that there is a strong basis for further

  abstract = "Abstract Today’s interconnected socio-economic and environmental
              challenges require the combination and reuse of existing
              integrated modelling solutions. This paper contributes to this
              overall research area, by reviewing a wide range of currently
              available frameworks, systems and emerging technologies for
              integrated modelling in the environmental sciences. Based on a
              systematic review of the literature, we group related studies and
              papers into viewpoints and elaborate on shared and diverging
              characteristics. Our analysis shows that component-based
              modelling frameworks and scientific workflow systems have been
              traditionally used for solving technical integration challenges,
              but ultimately, the appropriate framework or system strongly
              depends on the particular environmental phenomenon under
              investigation. The study also shows that -- in general --
              individual integrated modelling solutions do not benefit from
              components and models that are provided by others. It is this
              island (or silo) situation, which results in low levels of model
              reuse for multi-disciplinary settings. This seems mainly due to
              the fact that the field as such is highly complex and diverse. A
              unique integrated modelling solution, which is capable of dealing
              with any environmental scenario, seems to be unaffordable because
              of the great variety of data formats, models, environmental
              phenomena, stakeholder networks, user perspectives and social
              aspects. Nevertheless, we conclude that the combination of
              modelling tools, which address complementary viewpoints -- such
              as service-based combined with scientific workflow systems, or
              resource-modelling on top of virtual research environments --
              could lead to sustainable information systems, which would
              advance model sharing, reuse and integration. Next steps for
              improving this form of multi-disciplinary interoperability are

                 Don't Embrace Open Access. The Guardian 2012]. By the use of
                 high-throughput methods in many research areas from physics to
                 systems biology, large data collections are increasingly
                 important as raw material for research. Here, we present
                 strategies worked out by international and national
                 institutions targeting open access to publicly funded research
                 data via incentives or obligations to share data. Funding
                 organizations such as the British Wellcome Trust therefore
                 have developed data sharing policies and request commitment to
                 data management and sharing in grant applications. Increased
                 citation rates are a profound argument for sharing publication
                 data. Pre-publication sharing might be rewarded by a data
                 citation credit system via digital object identifiers (DOIs)
                 which have initially been in use for data objects. Besides
                 policies and incentives, good practice in data management is
                 indispensable. However, appropriate systems for data

  abstract = "AbstractContext Following the evolution of the business needs,
              the requirements of software systems change continuously and new
              requirements emerge frequently. Requirements documents are often
              textual artifacts with structure not explicitly given. When a
              change in a requirements document is introduced, the requirements
              engineer may have to manually analyze all the requirements for a
              single change. This may result in neglecting the actual impact of
              a change. Consequently, the cost of implementing a change may
              become several times higher than expected. Objective In this
              paper, we aim at improving change impact analysis in requirements
              by using formal semantics of requirements relations and
              requirements change types. Method In our previous work we present
              a requirements metamodel with commonly used requirements relation
              types and their semantics formalized in first-order logic. In
              this paper the classification of requirements changes based on
              structure of a textual requirement is provided with formal
              semantics. The formalization of requirements relations and
              changes is used for propagating proposed changes and consistency
              checking of proposed changes in requirements models. The tool
              support for change impact analysis in requirements models is an
              extension of our Tool for Requirements Inferencing and
              Consistency Checking (TRIC). Results The described approach for
              change impact analysis helps in the elimination of some false
              positive impacts in change propagation, and enables consistency
              checking of changes. Conclusion We illustrate our approach in an
              example which shows that the formal semantics of requirements
              relations and change classification enables change alternatives
              to be proposed semi-automatically, the reduction of some false
              positive impacts and contradicting changes in requirements to be
              determined.",

                   three-dimensional quantum gravity with a class of local
                   observables is developed. The main definition of the
                   Ponzano-Regge model in this paper is determined by its
                   reformulation in terms of group variables. The
                   regularisation is defined and a proof is given that the
                   partition function is well-defined only when a certain
                   cohomological criterion is satisfied. In that case, the
                   partition function may be expressed in terms of a
                   topological invariant, the Reidemeister torsion. This proves
                   the independence of our definition on the triangulation of
                   the 3-manifold and on those arbitrary choices made in the
                   regularisation. A further corollary is that when the
                   observable is a knot, the partition function (when it
                   exists) can be written in terms of the Alexander polynomial
                   of the knot. Various examples of observables in the
                   three-sphere are computed explicitly. Alternative
                   regularisations of the Ponzano-Regge model by the simple
                   cutoff procedure and by the limit of the Turaev-Viro model

                   connecting gauge theory to powerful mathematical structures
                   such as the Grassmannian. We perform a detailed
                   investigation of the combinatorial and geometric objects
                   associated to these graphs. We mainly focus on their
                   relation to polytopes and toric geometry, the Grassmannian
                   and its stratification. Our work extends the current
                   understanding of these connections along several important
                   fronts, most notably eliminating restrictions imposed by
                   planarity, positivity, reducibility and edge removability.
                   We illustrate our ideas with several explicit examples and

                   In this approach, a three dimensional manifold $M$ is
                   decomposed into a collection of tetrahedra, and it is
                   assumed that each tetrahedron is filled in with flat space

               when the ambient space is Euclidean. This theory is built on
               ideas from algebraic topology, exterior calculus, and the recent
               developments of discrete exterior calculus. We first review some
               geometric ideas in continuum mechanics and show how constitutive
               equations of linearized elasticity, similar to those of
               electromagnetism, can be written in terms of a material Hodge
               star operator. In the discrete theory presented in this paper,
               instead of referring to continuum quantities, we postulate the
               existence of some discrete scalar-valued and vector-valued
               primal and dual differential forms on a discretized solid, which
               is assumed to be a triangulated domain. We find the discrete
               governing equations by requiring energy balance invariance under
               time-dependent rigid translations and rotations of the ambient
               space. There are several subtle differences between the discrete
               and continuous theories. For example, power of tractions in the
               discrete theory is written on a layer of cells with a nonzero
               volume. We obtain the compatibility equations of this discrete
               theory using tools from algebraic topology. We study a discrete
               Cosserat medium and obtain its governing equations. Finally, we
               study the geometric structure of linearized elasticity and write
               its governing equations in a matrix form. We show that, in
               addition to constitutive equations, balance of angular momentum

                   and condensed matter has prompted a prosperous activity at
                   the border of these disciplines that were far distant until
                   few years ago. Numerous interesting questions have been
                   addressed so far. Here we review an important part of this
                   field, the properties of the entanglement in many-body
                   systems. We discuss the zero and finite temperature
                   properties of entanglement in interacting spin, fermionic
                   and bosonic model systems. Both bipartite and multipartite
                   entanglement will be considered. At equilibrium we emphasize
                   on how entanglement is connected to the phase diagram of the
                   underlying model. The behavior of entanglement can be
                   related, via certain witnesses, to thermodynamic quantities
                   thus offering interesting possibilities for an experimental
                   test. Out of equilibrium we discuss how to generate and
                   manipulate entangled states by means of many-body
                   Hamiltonians.",

  abstract      = "In 1961 Tullio Regge provided us with a beautiful lattice
                   representation of Einstein's geometric theory of gravity.
                   This Regge Calculus (RC) is strikingly different from the
                   more usual finite difference and finite element
                   discretizations of gravity. In RC the fundamental principles
                   of General Relativity are applied directly to a tessellated
                   spacetime geometry. In this manuscript, and in the spirit of
                   this conference, we reexamine the foundations of RC and
                   emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay
                   lattices play in this discrete theory. In particular we
                   describe, for the first time, a geometric construction of
                   the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This derivation
                   makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from
                   elements inherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay)
                   spacetime and its circumcentric dual (Voronoi) lattice. The
                   orthogonality properties between these two lattices yield an
                   expression for the vertex-based scalar curvature which is
                   strikingly similar to the corresponding and more familiar
                   hinge-based expression in RC (deficit angle per unit Voronoi
                   dual area). In particular, we show that the scalar curvature
                   is simply a vertex-based weighted average of deficits per
                   weighted average of dual areas. What is most striking to us
                   is how naturally spacetime is represented by Voronoi and
                   Delaunay structures and that the laws of gravity appear to
                   be encoded locally on the lattice spacetime with less
                   complexity than in the continuum, yet the continuum is
                   recovered by convergence in mean. Perhaps these prominent
                   features may enable us to transcend the details of any
                   particular discrete model gravitation and yield clues to
                   help us discover how we may begin to quantize this
                   fundamental interaction.",

                   processes. In the context of categorical quantum mechanics,
                   Coecke and Kissinger suggested that two 3-qubit states, GHZ

                   calculus, aimed at a diagrammatic classification of

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: BioClojure is an open-source library for the
                 manipulation of biological sequence data written in the
                 language Clojure. BioClojure aims to provide a functional
                 framework for the processing of biological sequence data that
                 provides simple mechanisms for concurrency and lazy evaluation
                 of large datasets. RESULTS: BioClojure provides parsers and
                 accessors for a range of biological sequence formats,
                 including UniProtXML, Genbank XML, FASTA and FASTQ. In
                 addition, it provides wrappers for key analysis programs,
                 including BLAST, SignalP, TMHMM and InterProScan, and parsers
                 for analyzing their output. All interfaces leverage Clojure's
                 functional style and emphasize laziness and composability, so
                 that BioClojure, and user-defined, functions can be chained
                 into simple pipelines that are thread-safe and seamlessly
                 integrate lazy evaluation. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:
                 BioClojure is distributed under the Lesser GPL, and the source
                 code is freely available from GitHub

              electronic medical record systems, telephone exchange systems,
              etc. In such fundamental systems, we desire not only correctness
              but also robustness. Formal methods, such as software
              verification, have focused on correctness rather than robustness.
              The Spice calculus, which was proposed by Nishizaki et al., is a
              calculus process which enables us to formalize and analyze the
              resistance of communication protocols against Denial-of-Service
              attacks. The key idea of the analysis is analyzing costs of
              initiators and responders in communication protocols. In this
              paper, we extend the target area of systems to be analyzed by the
              Spice calculus and describe a new analysis methodology for
              distributed systems. We demonstrate analysis of a telephone
              exchange system, as an example of our methodology. In this paper,
              we extend the target area of systems to be analyzed by the Spice

  abstract  = "Background Design is essential to the engineering profession and
               plays a crucial role in preparation for future practice.
               Research investigating variations of how professional designers
               experience, give meaning to, and approach design can inform the
               ways we characterize, assess, and facilitate design learning.
               This may also have significant implications for preparing future
               engineering professionals to collaborate within and across
               disciplines. Purpose (Hypothesis) The goal of the study was to
               reveal and investigate critical differences in how designers
               from within and outside of engineering disciplines understand
               what it means to design, and how those understandings are
               evident in their approaches to and progression through design
               work. Design/Method A qualitative research approach called
               phenomenography was used to investigate critical variations in
               how individuals experience and understand design. Twenty
               practicing designers were interviewed regarding their design
               experiences, how they approach design, and the ways they
               understand design. Conclusions Six qualitatively distinct lenses
               on how individuals across disciplines experience and come to
               understand design emerged, comprising a phenomenographic
               ``outcome space.'' These include design as (1) evidencebased
               decision-making, (2) organized translation, (3) personal
               synthesis, (4) intentional progression, (5) directed creative
               exploration, and (6) freedom. Theoretical implications include
               an understanding of how design skills and knowledge come
               together to form a design approach, while practical implications
               emphasize structuring variation-based reflection, which can
               facilitate common ground as a result of recognizing differ

               that (a) characterizes design as a radial category and fleshes
               out the task environment of the prototypical cases; (b) takes
               the task environment seriously; (c) shows that this task
               environment occurs in design tasks, but does not occur in every

                 others, in which case it is known as mentalizing. Both kinds
                 of metacognition have implicit and explicit forms, where
                 implicit means automatic and without awareness. Implicit
                 metacognition enables us to adopt a we-mode, through which we
                 automatically take account of the knowledge and intentions of
                 others. Adoption of this mode enhances joint action. Explicit
                 metacognition enables us to reflect on and justify our
                 behaviour to others. However, access to the underlying
                 processes is very limited for both self and others and our
                 reports on our own and others' intentions can be very
                 inaccurate. On the other hand, recent experiments have shown
                 that, through discussions of our perceptual experiences with
                 others, we can detect sensory signals more accurately, even in
                 the absence of objective feedback. Through our willingness to
                 discuss with others the reasons for our actions and
                 perceptions, we overcome our lack of direct access to the
                 underlying cognitive processes. This creates the potential for
                 us to build more accurate accounts of the world and of
                 ourselves. I suggest, therefore, that explicit metacognition
                 is a uniquely human ability that has evolved through its
                 enhancement of collaborative decision-making.",

                 animal decision makers choose between two or more options,
                 posed in advance by the researchers. The mechanisms by which
                 options are generated for most decisions, however, are not
                 well understood. Models of sequential search have examined the
                 trade-off between continued exploration and choosing one's
                 current best option, but still cannot explain the processes by
                 which new options are generated. We argue that understanding
                 the origins of options is a crucial but untapped area for
                 decision making research. We explore a number of factors which
                 influence the generation of options, which fall broadly into
                 two categories: psycho-biological and socio-cultural. The
                 former category includes factors such as perceptual biases and
                 associative memory networks. The latter category relies on the
                 incredible human capacity for culture and social learning,
                 which doubtless shape not only our choices but the options
                 available for choice. Our intention is to start a discussion

              of knowledge-based systems as patterns of behavior that can be
              reused across applications. While the availability of extensive
              problem solving method libraries and the emerging consensus on
              problem solving method specification languages indicate the
              maturity of the field, a number of important research issues are
              still open. In particular, very little progress has been achieved
              on foundational and methodological issues. Hence, despite the
              number of libraries which have been developed, it is still not
              clear what organization principles should be adopted to construct
              truly comprehensive libraries, covering large numbers of
              applications and encompassing both task-specific and
              task-independent problem solving methods. In this paper, we
              address these ``fundamental'' issues and present a comprehensive
              and detailed framework for characterizing problem solving methods
              and their development process. In particular, we suggest that PSM
              development consists of introducing assumptions and commitments

              problem-solving strategy, task commitments, and domain
              (knowledge) assumptions. Individual moves through this space can
              be formally described by means of adapters. In the paper, we
              illustrate our approach and argue that our architecture provides
              answers to three fundamental problems related to research in
              problem solving methods: 1) what is the epistemological structure
              and what are the modeling primitives of PSMs? 2) how can we model
              the PSM development process? and 3) how can we develop and
              organize truly comprehensive and manageable libraries of problem
              solving methods?",

              behavioral methods or new technologies like groupware, should be
              based on detailed knowledge about how groups work, what they do
              well, and what they have trouble with. Such data can be used to
              suggest what kinds of tools people might need as well as to
              provide a baseline for evaluating the effects of schemes for
              improvement. We present details of how real groups engage in a
              representative collaborative task---early software design
              meetings---to provide such knowledge. We studied 10 design
              meetings from four projects in two organizations. The meetings
              were videotaped, transcribed, and then analyzed using a coding
              scheme that looked at participants' problem solving and the
              activities they used to coordinate and manage themselves. We also
              analyzed the structure of their design arguments. We found, to
              our surprise, that although the meetings differed in how many
              issues were covered they were strikingly similar in both how
              people spent their time and in the sequential organization of
              that activity. Overall, only 40\% of the time was spent in direct
              discussions of design, with many swift transitions between
              alternative ideas and their evaluation. The groups spent another
              30\% taking stock of their progress through walkthroughs and
              summaries. Pure coordination activities consumed about 20\%, and
              clarification of ideas---a cross-cutting classification---took
              one third of the time, indicating how much time was spent in both
              orchestrating and sharing expertise among group members. The
              pattern of transitions revealed these activities were clustered
              into two general classes---design and management. Although most
              issues had more than one alternative offered and discussed, there
              was rarely a wide set discussed, and one third of them were never
              explicitly evaluated. The results have implications for both the
              characterization of collaboration itself and for the way in which
              it might be supported through technology. Finally, the coding
              schemes developed may be useful for a wide range of
              problem-solving meetings other than design.",

                 method for CDM in intelligent and automatic manners. It mainly
                 includes three phases: semantic-based capacity evaluation for
                 the CDM sponsor, trust computation of the CDM organization,
                 and negotiation selection of the decision-making service
                 provider (DMSP). In the first phase, the CDM sponsor produces
                 the formal semantic description of the complex decision task
                 for DMSP and computes the capacity evaluation values according
                 to participator instructions from different DMSPs. In the
                 second phase, a novel trust computation approach is presented
                 to compute the subjective belief value, the objective
                 reputation value, and the recommended trust value. And in the
                 third phase, based on the capacity evaluation and trust
                 computation, a negotiation mechanism is given to efficiently
                 implement the service selection. The simulation experiment

              design solves a number of problems facing researchers working in

              situated, local accomplishment involving diverse and multiple

              constituting practices. Third, it de-centers the designer as the

              previously solved problems that have been encountered and
              remembered as cases. In some domains, particularly where the
              problem solving is a classification task, the retrieved solution
              can be reused directly. But for design tasks it is common for the
              retrieved solution to be regarded as an initial solution that
              should be refined to reflect the differences between the new and
              retrieved problems. The acquisition of adaptation knowledge to
              achieve this refinement can be demanding, despite the fact that
              the knowledge source of stored cases captures a substantial part
              of the problem-solving expertise. This paper describes an
              introspective learning approach where the case knowledge itself
              provides a source from which training data for the adaptation
              task can be assembled. Different learning algorithms are explored

              adaptation as a further reasoning step after nearest-neighbour
              retrieval. A new property-based classification to adapt symbolic
              values is proposed, and an ensemble of these property-based

  abstract = "The concept of similarity plays a fundamental role in case-based
              reasoning. However, the meaning of ``similarity'' can vary in
              situations and is largely domain dependent. This paper proposes a
              novel similarity model consisting of linguistic fuzzy rules as
              the knowledge container. We believe that fuzzy rules
              representation offers a more flexible means to express the
              knowledge and criteria for similarity assessment than traditional
              similarity metrics. The learning of fuzzy similarity rules is
              performed by exploiting the case base, which is utilized as a
              valuable resource with hidden knowledge for similarity learning.
              A sample of similarity is created from a pair of known cases in
              which the vicinity of case solutions reveals the similarity of
              case problems. We do pair-wise comparisons of cases in the case
              base to derive adequate training examples for learning fuzzy
              similarity rules. The empirical studies have demonstrated that
              the proposed approach is capable of discovering fuzzy similarity
              knowledge from a rather low number of cases, giving rise to the
              competence of CBR systems to work on a small case library.",

  abstract = "In this paper we try to improve the retrieval step for case based
              reasoning for preliminary design. This improvement deals with
              three major parts of our CBR system. First, in the preliminary
              design step, some uncertainties like imprecise or unknown values
              remain in the description of the problem, because they need a
              deeper analysis to be withdrawn. To deal with this issue, the
              faced problem description is soften with the fuzzy sets theory.
              Features are described with a central value, a percentage of
              imprecision and a relation with respect to the central value.
              These additional data allow us to build a domain of possible
              values for each attributes. With this representation, the
              calculation of the similarity function is impacted, thus the
              characteristic function is used to calculate the local similarity
              between two features. Second, we focus our attention on the main
              goal of the retrieve step in CBR to find relevant cases for
              adaptation. In this second part, we discuss the assumption of
              similarity to find the more appropriated case. We put in
              highlight that in some situations this classical similarity must
              be improved with further knowledge to facilitate case adaptation.
              To avoid failure during the adaptation step, we implement a
              method that couples similarity measurement with adaptability one,
              in order to approximate the cases utility more accurately. The
              latter gives deeper information for the reusing of cases. In a
              last part, we present a generic indexing technique for the base,
              and a new algorithm for the research of relevant cases in the
              memory. The sphere indexing algorithm is a domain independent
              index that has performances equivalent to the decision tree ones.
              But its main strength is that it puts the current problem in the
              center of the research area avoiding boundaries issues. All these
              points are discussed and exemplified through the preliminary

              It focuses on cognitive, dynamic aspects of real design, that is,
              the actual cognitive activity implemented by designers during
              their work on professional design projects. Rather than
              conceiving designing as problem solving---Simon's symbolic
              information processing (SIP) approach---or as a reflective
              practice or some other form of situated activity---the
              situativity (SIT) approach---we consider that, from a cognitive
              viewpoint, designing is most appropriately characterised as a
              construction of representations. After a critical discussion of
              the SIP and SIT approaches to design, we present our viewpoint.
              This presentation concerns the evolving nature of representations
              regarding levels of abstraction and degrees of precision, the
              function of external representations, and specific qualities of
              representation in collective design. Designing is described at
              three levels: the organisation of the activity, its strategies,
              and its design-representation construction activities (different
              ways to generate, transform, and evaluate representations). Even
              if we adopt a ``generic design'' stance, we claim that design can
              take different forms depending on the nature of the artefact, and
              we propose some candidates for dimensions that allow a
              distinction to be made between these forms of design. We discuss
              the potential specificity of HCI design, and the lack of
              cognitive design research occupied with the quality of design. We
              close our discussion of representational structures and
              activities by an outline of some directions regarding their

  abstract = "Thyroid cancers are the most common endocrine carcinomas.
              Case-based reasoning (CBR) is used in this paper to describe a
              physician’s expertise, intuition and experience when treating
              patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer. Various
              clinical parameters (the patient’s diagnosis, the patient’s age,
              the tumor size, the existence of metastases in the lymph nodes
              and the existence of distant metastases) influence a physician’s
              decision-making in dose planning. The weights (importance) of
              these parameters are determined here with the Bee Colony
              Optimization (BCO) meta-heuristic. The proposed CBR--BCO model
              suggests the I-131 iodine dose in radioactive iodine therapy.
              This approach is tested on real data from patients treated in the
              Department of Nuclear Medicine, Clinical Center Kragujevac,
              Serbia. By comparing the results that are obtained through the
              developed CBR--BCO model with those resulting from the
              physician’s decision, it has been found that the developed model

  title    = "Case-based predictions for species and habitat mapping",
  author   = "Remm, Kalle",
  abstract = "The specific feature of case-based predictions is the presence of
              empirical data within a predicting system. Case-based methods are
              especially well suited to situations where a single class is
              represented by more than one cluster, or a class fills an
              irregular shape in the feature space. Case-based ecological
              mapping relies on the assumption of finding a species (or other
              phenomenon) in locations similar to those where this species has
              already been registered. Lazy learning is a machine learning
              approach for fitting case-based prediction systems, which prefers
              raw data to generalizations. An overview of lazy learning
              methods: feature selection and weighting, fitting the number of
              exemplars or kernel extent used for decisions, indexing the
              case-base, learning new and forgetting useless exemplars, and
              exemplar weighting, is given. A case study of habitat and forest
              composition mapping was accomplished in Otep{\"{a}}{\"{a}} Upland
              in South-East Estonia. Habitat classes were predicted and mapped
              on the whole study area; five characteristics of stand
              composition, presence/absence of Quercus robur, total coverage of
              forest stand, coverage of coniferous trees, and eight main tree
              species separately, were mapped on non-agricultural and
              non-settlement areas. The explanatory variables were derived
              from: Landsat 7 ETM image, greyscale and colour orthophotos,
              elevation model, 1:10 000 digital base map, and soil map. One
              thousand random locations were described in the field in order to
              obtain training data. Four methods of machine learning were
              compared. In calculations of similarity, exemplar and feature
              weights regulated both the influence of particular exemplars and
              features, and kernel extent. Goodness-of-fit of predictions was
              estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation. A machine
              learning method combining stepwise feature selection, feature
              weighting, and exemplar weighting reached the best results in the
              case of 10 response variables. A method involving iterative
              random sampling proved to be the best for the other seven
              variables. The best fit was found for variables: habitat class
              ($\kappa$=0.85), oak presence/absence (mean true positive+mean
              true negative−1=0.72), coverage of coniferous trees (R2=0.80),
              coverage of Pinus sylvestris (R2=0.72), and coverage of Picea
              abies (R2=0.73). In most cases, less than a half of training
              instances were retained as exemplars after case filtering, and
              less than half of the explanatory variables were used in
              predictive sets. All 31 explanatory variables were included in a
              predictive set of features at least once. The most valuable
              predictor was land cover category according to the 1:10,000 base

  abstract = "This paper presents on a Case-based Reasoning approach for
              automated workflow adaptation by reuse of experience. Agile
              workflow technology allows structural adaptations of workflow
              instances at build time or at run time. The approach supports the
              expert in performing such adaptations by an automated method. The
              method employs workflow adaptation cases that record adaptation
              episodes from the past. The recorded changes can be automatically
              transferred to a new workflow that is in a similar situation of
              change. First, the notion of workflow adaptation cases is
              introduced. The sample workflow modeling language CFCN is
              presented, which has been developed by the University of Trier as
              a part of the agile workflow management system Cake. Then, the
              retrieval of adaptation cases is briefly discussed. The
              case-based adaptation method is explained including the so-called
              anchor mapping algorithm which identifies the parts of the target
              workflow where to apply the changes. A formative evaluation in
              two application domains compares different variants of the anchor

               to the nature of the problems that provide the focus for PBL. In
               this paper, we articulate a model for evaluating problem

  abstract = "In this paper, we propose a generic library of problem-solving
              methods for scheduling applications. Although some attempts have
              been made in the past at developing the libraries of scheduling
              problem-solvers, these only provide limited coverage. Many lack
              generality, as they subscribe to a particular scheduling domain.
              Others simply implement a particular problem-solving technique,
              which may be applicable only to a subset of the space of
              scheduling problems. In addition, most of these libraries fail to
              provide the required degree of depth and precision. In our
              approach, we subscribe to the task-method-domain-application
              knowledge modeling framework which provides a structured
              organization for the different components of the library. At the
              task level, we construct a generic scheduling task ontology to
              formalize the space of scheduling problems. At the method level,
              we construct a generic problem-solving model of scheduling that
              generalizes from the variety of approaches to scheduling
              problem-solving, which can be found in the literature. The
              generic nature of this model is demonstrated by constructing
              seven methods for scheduling as an alternative specialization of
              the model. Finally, we validated our library on a number of
              applications to demonstrate its generic nature and effective
              support for developing scheduling applications",

              the way doctors make a diagnosis. Given a new case, its accuracy
              in practice depends on successful retrieval of similar cases. CBR
              systems have had some success in dealing with simple diseases
              because of the robustness of their case base. However, their
              diagnostic accuracy suffers when dealing with complex diseases
              particularly those that involve multiple domains in medicine. An
              example of such a condition is Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) as it
              falls under both gynaecology and psychiatry. To address this
              issue, the paper proposes a CBR-based expert system that uses the
              K-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm to search k similar cases
              based on the Euclidean distance measure. The novelty of the

              which serves as a threshold to extract cases for which
              similarities are greater than the assigned value of T. A
              prototype software tool with a menu-driven Graphical User
              Interface (GUI) has been developed for case input, analysis of
              results, and case adaptation within the system. Finally, the

                   public log called the blockchain. Its security rests
                   critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the
                   blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional
                   wisdom asserts that the protocol is incentive-compatible and
                   secure against colluding minority groups, i.e., it
                   incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We
                   show that the Bitcoin protocol is not incentive-compatible.
                   We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a
                   revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have
                   significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will
                   prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group
                   will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this
                   point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized
                   currency. Selfish mining is feasible for any group size of
                   colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the
                   Bitcoin protocol that protects against selfish mining pools
                   that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold
                   is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than
                   the current reality where a group of any size can compromise

  title    = "Extreme Learning Machine for Multilayer Perceptron",
  author   = "Tang, Jiexiong and Deng, Chenwei and Huang, Guang-Bin",
  abstract = "Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm
              for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural
              networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly
              generated and the output weights are analytically computed.
              However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using
              ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g.,
              images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To
              address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical
              learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The
              proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1)
              self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature
              classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized
              hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1)
              unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature
              extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via
              ℓ₁ constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and
              meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by
              exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the
              hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before
              final decision making, which leads to a better generalization
              with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise
              training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed
              framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous
              layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed
              without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning
              efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely
              used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm
              achieves better and faster convergence than the existing
              state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore,
              multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the
              generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.",

              detail the basic strokes of Chinese characters, we propose that
              font recognition on a single Chinese character is a sequence
              classification problem, which can be effectively solved by
              recurrent neural networks. For robust CCFR, we integrate a
              principal component convolution layer with the 2-D long
              short-term memory (2DLSTM) and develop principal component 2DLSTM
              (PC-2DLSTM) algorithm. PC-2DLSTM considers two aspects: 1) the
              principal component layer convolution operation helps remove the
              noise and get a rational and complete font information and 2)
              simultaneously, 2DLSTM deals with the long-range contextual
              processing along scan directions that can contribute to capture
              the contrast between character trajectory and background.
              Experiments using the frequently used CCFR dataset suggest the

                   has been shown a promising learning algorithm for
                   single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs).
                   Nevertheless, because of the random choice of input weights
                   and biases, the ELM algorithm sometimes makes the hidden
                   layer output matrix H of SLFN not full column rank, which
                   lowers the effectiveness of ELM. This paper discusses the
                   effectiveness of ELM and proposes an improved algorithm

  abstract = "As the Internet has evolved and grown, an increasing number of
              nodes (hosts or autonomous systems) have become multihomed, i.e.,
              a node is connected to more than one network. Mobility can be
              viewed as a special case of multihoming---as a node moves, it
              unsubscribes from one network and subscribes to another, which is
              akin to one interface becoming inactive and another active. The
              current Internet architecture has been facing significant
              challenges in effectively dealing with multihoming (and
              consequently mobility), which has led to the emergence of several
              custom point-solutions. The Recursive InterNetwork Architecture
              (RINA) was recently proposed as a clean-slate solution to the
              current problems of the Internet. In this paper, we present a
              specification of the process of ROuting in Recursive
              Architectures (RORA). We also perform an average-case cost
              analysis to compare the multihoming/mobility support of RINA,
              against that of other approaches such as LISP and Mobile-IP.
              Extensive experimental results confirm the premise that the RINA
              architecture and its RORA routing approach are inherently better

               effort, the type of change they wish to detect. Our algorithms

               normalised programs in order to detect non-trivial and relevant
               differences. We evaluate our tool on a benchmark of programs to

  abstract = "Abstract Model-driven engineering proposes the use of models to
              describe the relevant aspects of the system to be built and
              synthesize the final application from them. Models are normally
              described using Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs), which
              provide primitives and constructs of the domain. Still, the
              increasing complexity of systems has raised the need for
              abstraction techniques able to produce simpler versions of the
              models while retaining some properties of interest. The problem
              is that developing such abstractions for each DSML from scratch
              is time and resource consuming. In this paper, our goal is
              reducing the effort to provide modeling languages with
              abstraction mechanisms. For this purpose, we have devised some
              techniques, based on generic programming and domain-specific
              meta-modeling, to define generic abstraction operations that can
              be reused over families of modeling languages sharing certain
              characteristics. Abstractions can make use of clustering
              algorithms as similarity criteria for model elements. These
              algorithms can be made generic as well, and customized for
              particular languages by means of annotation models. As a result,
              we have developed a catalog of reusable abstractions using the
              proposed techniques, together with a working implementation in
              the MetaDepth multi-level meta-modeling tool. Our techniques and
              prototypes demonstrate that it is feasible to build reusable and
              adaptable abstractions, so that similar abstractions need not be
              developed from scratch, and their integration in new or existing
              modeling languages is less costly.",

                   modal logic\}. A refinement is like a bisimulation, except
                   that from the three relational requirements only `atoms' and
                   `back' need to be satisfied. Our logic contains a new
                   operator 'all' in addition to the standard modalities 'box'
                   for each agent. The operator 'all' acts as a quantifier over
                   the set of all refinements of a given model. As a variation
                   on a bisimulation quantifier, this refinement operator or
                   refinement quantifier 'all' can be seen as quantifying over
                   a variable not occurring in the formula bound by it. The
                   logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal logic
                   with some powers of monadic second-order quantification. We
                   present a sound and complete axiomatization of multi-agent

                   the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and

              equational theories or equality is mandatory. In this paper, we
              show how to integrate a modern treatment of equality in the Model
              Evolution calculus ( ME ), a first-order version of the
              propositional DPLL procedure. The new calculus, ME E , is a
              proper extension of the ME calculus without equality. Like ME it
              maintains an explicit candidate model, which is searched for by
              DPLL-style splitting. For equational reasoning ME E uses an
              adapted version of the superposition inference rule, where
              equations used for superposition are drawn (only) from the

              course of the complete life cycle of complex software-intensive
              systems and more importantly of entire product families. Not only
              instance models, but also entire modelling languages are subject
              to change. This is in particular true for domain-specific
              languages, whose language constructs are tightly coupled to an
              application domain. The most popular approach to evolution in the
              modelling domain is a manual process, with tedious and
              error-prone migration of artefacts such as instance models as a
              result. This paper provides a taxonomy for evolution of modelling
              languages and discusses the different evolution scenarios for
              various kinds of modelling artefacts, such as instance models,
              meta-models, and transformation models. Subsequently, the
              consequences of evolution and the required remedial actions are
              decomposed into primitive scenarios such that all possible
              evolutions can be covered exhaustively. These primitives are then
              used in a high-level framework for the evolution of modelling
              languages. We suggest that our structured approach enables the

  abstract  = "In this publication we will look at the different methods
               presented over the past few decades which attempt to recreate
               digital paintings. While previous surveys concentrate on the
               broader subject of non-photorealistic rendering, the focus of
               this paper is firmly placed on painterly rendering techniques.
               We compare different methods used to produce different output
               painting styles such as abstract, colour pencil, watercolour,
               oriental, oil and pastel. Whereas some methods demand a high
               level of interaction using a skilled artist, others require
               simple parameters provided by a user with little or no artistic
               experience. Many methods attempt to provide more automation with
               the use of varying forms of reference data. This reference data
               can range from still photographs, video, 3D polygonal meshes or
               even 3D point clouds. The techniques presented here endeavour to
               provide tools and styles that are not traditionally available to

               the display of three-dimensional worlds using various display
               models. In particular, recent work has focused on the modeling
               of traditional artistic media and styles such as pen-and-ink
               illustration and watercolor painting. By providing 3D rendering
               systems that use these alternative display models users can
               generate traditional illustration renderings of their
               three-dimensional worlds. In this paper we present our graphite
               pencil 3D renderer. We have broken the problem of simulating
               pencil drawing down into four fundamental parts: (1) simulating
               the drawing materials (graphite pencil and drawing paper,
               blenders and kneaded eraser), (2) modeling the drawing
               primitives (individual pencil strokes and mark-making to create
               tones and textures), (3) simulating the basic rendering
               techniques used by artists and illustrators familiar with pencil
               rendering, and (4) modeling the control of the drawing
               composition. Each part builds upon the others and is essential
               to developing the framework for higher-level rendering methods
               and tools. In this paper we present parts 2, 3, and 4 of our
               research. We present non-photorealistic graphite pencil
               rendering methods for outlining and shading. We also present the
               control of drawing steps from preparatory sketches to finished
               rendering results. We demonstrate the capabilities of our

              conditions was demonstrated, which used precise voxel-based tree
              models produced by high-resolution portable scanning lidar. In
              this voxel-based canopy profiling (VCP) method, data for each
              horizontal layer of the canopy of each tree were collected from
              symmetrical azimuthal measurement points around the tree using
              optimally inclined laser beams. The data were then converted into
              a voxel-based three-dimensional model that reproduced the tree
              precisely, including within the canopy. This precise voxel model
              allowed the LAD and LAI of these trees, which have extremely
              dense and nonrandomly distributed foliage, to be computed by
              direct counting of the beam-contact frequency in each layer using
              a point-quadrat method. Corrections for leaf inclination and
              nonphotosynthetic tissues reduced the estimation error. A beam
              incident zenith angle near 57.5deg offered a good correction for
              leaf inclination without knowledge of the actual leaf
              inclination. Non-photosynthetic tissues were removed by
              image-processing techniques. The best LAD estimations showed
              errors of 17\% at the minimum horizontal layer thickness and of

                 density over the atomic Voronoi cell. We compare our method to
                 the well-known Mulliken, Hirshfeld, Bader, and Weinhold
                 [Natural Population Analysis (NPA)] charges for a variety of
                 biological, organic, and inorganic molecules. The Mulliken
                 charges are (again) shown to be useless due to heavy basis set
                 dependency, and the Bader charges (and often also the NPA
                 charges) are not realistic, yielding too extreme values that
                 suggest much ionic character even in the case of covalent
                 bonds. The Hirshfeld and VDD charges, which prove to be
                 numerically very similar, are to be recommended because they
                 yield chemically meaningful charges. We stress the need to use
                 spatial integration over an atomic domain to get rid of basis
                 set dependency, and the need to integrate the deformation
                 density in order to obtain a realistic picture of the charge
                 rearrangement upon bonding. An asset of the VDD charges is the
                 transparency of the approach owing to the simple geometric
                 partitioning of space. The deformation density based charges

              that allow iterative abstraction of 2D maps. We use data from

                 interplay is impossible to understand intuitively.
                 Mathematical and computer modeling allows researchers to
                 design new hypotheses and produce experimentally testable

                 intuitive in silico objects (``cells'', ``regulation

                 modeling framework VirtualLeaf for plant tissue morphogenesis.
                 The current version defines a set of biologically intuitive
                 C++ objects, including cells, cell walls, and diffusing and
                 reacting chemicals, that provide useful abstractions for
                 building biological simulations of developmental processes. We
                 present a step-by-step introduction to building models with
                 VirtualLeaf, providing basic example models of leaf venation
                 and meristem development. VirtualLeaf-based models provide a

              artists to create complex and realistic marbling textures that
              can be used for design purposes. Our algorithm is unique in that
              the marbling paint on the surface of water is represented as an
              enclosed contour and is advected by fluid flow to deform the
              marbling silhouette. In contrast to previous methods, in which
              the shape is tracked with a concentration density field in
              Eulerian grids, our approach facilitates greater complexity that
              is free from grid resolution and per-pixel computation while
              retaining real-time performance. To forestall the propagation of
              large vertices, we adaptively resample the contours, exploiting
              the curvature and the turbulence of the fluid as criteria. At the
              convection phase, we parallelly advect contour particles on a

                 study of plant growth and developmental processes. By
                 formulating experimentally obtained knowledge as a system of
                 interacting mathematical equations, it becomes feasible for
                 biologists to gain a mechanistic understanding of the complex
                 behaviour of biological systems. In this review, the modelling
                 tools that are currently available and the progress that has
                 been made to model plant development, based on experimental
                 knowledge, are described. In terms of implementation, it is
                 argued that, for the modelling of plant organ growth, the
                 cellular level should form the cornerstone. It integrates the
                 output of molecular regulatory networks to two processes, cell
                 division and cell expansion, that drive growth and development
                 of the organ. In turn, these cellular processes are controlled
                 at the molecular level by hormone signalling. Therefore,
                 combining a cellular modelling framework with regulatory
                 modules for the regulation of cell division, expansion, and
                 hormone signalling could form the basis of a functional organ
                 growth simulation model. The current state of progress towards
                 this aim is that the regulation of the cell cycle and hormone
                 transport have been modelled extensively and these modules
                 could be integrated. However, much less progress has been made
                 on the modelling of cell expansion, which urgently needs to be
                 addressed. A limitation of the current generation models is
                 that they are largely qualitative. The possibilities to
                 characterize existing and future models more quantitatively
                 will be discussed. Together with experimental methods to
                 measure crucial model parameters, these modelling techniques
                 provide a basis to develop a Systems Biology approach to gain
                 a fundamental insight into the relationship between gene

                   scalar field matter with non-trivial potential and
                   non-standard kinetic term. The potential sources a dynamical
                   attractor solution with Ekpyrotic contraction which washes
                   out small amplitude anisotropies. At high energy densities
                   the field evolves into a ghost condensate, leading to a
                   nonsingular bounce. Following the bounce there is a smooth
                   transition to standard expanding radiation and matter
                   dominated phases. Using linear cosmological perturbation
                   theory we track each Fourier mode of the curvature
                   fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution. Using
                   standard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing
                   cosmologies we verify that the spectral index does not
                   change during the bounce. We show there is a controlled
                   period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude
                   for the perturbations (but not for gravitational waves)
                   around the bounce point which does not invalidate the
                   perturbative treatment. This growth induces a natural
                   suppression mechanism for the tensor to scalar ratio of
                   fluctuations. Moreover, we study the generation of the
                   primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations for
                   various types of initial conditions. For the pure vacuum
                   initial condition, on scales which exit the Hubble radius in
                   the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction, the spectrum is deeply
                   blue. For thermal particle initial condition, one
                   possibility for generating a scale-invariant spectrum makes
                   use of a special value of the background equation of state
                   during the contracting Ekpyrotic phase. If the Ekpyrotic
                   phase is preceded by a period of matter-dominated
                   contraction, the primordial power spectrum is nearly
                   scale-invariant on large scales (scales which exit the
                   Hubble radius in the matter-dominated phase) but acquires a
                   large blue tilt on small scales.",

                 inherently extensible and can be integrated with other
                 modelling modalities (e.g. partial or ordinary differential

                 hierarchical agent models may be used to explore the functions
                 of biological systems across temporal and spatial scales. This
                 review examines individual-based models and the application of
                 the paradigm to explore multi-scale phenomena in biology. In
                 so doing, it demonstrates how cellular-based models have begun
                 to play an important role in the development of 'middle-out'
                 models, but with considerable potential for future

                   the interstellar radiation field and molecular
                   self-shielding determines what fraction of the gas is in
                   molecular form and thus eligible to form stars. Second,
                   internal feedback determines the properties of the molecular
                   clouds that form, which are nearly independent of galaxy
                   properties until the galactic ISM pressure becomes
                   comparable to the internal GMC pressure. Above this limit,
                   galactic ISM pressure determines molecular gas properties.
                   Third, the turbulence driven by feedback processes in GMCs
                   makes star formation slow, allowing a small fraction of the
                   gas to be converted to stars per free-fall time within the
                   molecular clouds. We combine analytic estimates for each of

                   decomposition. The SVT decomposes a whole space into
                   polyhedra and allows their flat borders to move by assigning
                   different weights. The forest method determines these
                   weights based on the load balancing among processors by
                   means of the over-load diffusion (OLD). Moreover, since all
                   the borders are flat, before receiving the data from other
                   processors, each processor can collect enough data to
                   calculate the gravity force with precision. Both the SVT and
                   the OLD are coded in a highly vectorizable manner to

              eukaryotic clade (in all ploidy levels) and numerous times among
              the prokaryotes. According to a standard multilevel selection
              (MLS) model, in each case, the evolution of multicellularity
              required the acquisition of cell--cell adhesion, communication,
              cooperation, and specialization attended by a compulsory
              alignment-of-fitness phase and an export-of-fitness phase to
              eliminate cell--cell conflict and to establish a reproductively
              integrated phenotype. These achievements are reviewed in terms of
              generalized evolutionary developmental motifs (or ``modules'')
              whose overall logic constructs were mobilized and executed
              differently in bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. When mapped
              onto a matrix of theoretically possible body plan morphologies
              (i.e., a morphospace), these motifs and the MLS model identify a
              ``unicellular ⇒ colonial ⇒ multicellular'' transformation series
              of body plans that mirrors trends observed in the majority of
              algae (i.e., a polyphyletic collection of photoautotrophic
              eukaryotes) and in the land plants, fungi, and animals. However,
              an alternative, more direct route to multicellularity
              theoretically exists, which may account for some aspects of
              fungal and algal evolution, i.e., a ``siphonous ⇒ multicellular''
              transformation series. This review of multicellularity attempts
              to show that natural selection typically acts on functional
              traits rather than on the mechanisms that generate them (``Many
              roads lead to Rome.'') and that genome sequence homologies do not
              invariably translate into morphological homologies (``Rome isn’t

              required artifact get more refined only as the design process
              moves toward its goal. An effective computer support tool that
              helps the designer make better-informed decisions requires
              efficient knowledge representation schemes. In today’s world,
              there is a virtual explosion in the amount of raw data available
              to the designer, and knowledge representation is critical in
              order to sift through this data and make sense of it. In
              addition, the need to stay competitive has shrunk product
              development time through the use of simultaneous and
              collaborative design processes, which depend on effective
              transfer of knowledge between teams. Finally, the awareness that
              decisions made early in the design process have a higher impact
              in terms of energy, cost, and sustainability, has resulted in the
              need to project knowledge typically required in the later stages
              of design to the earlier stages. Research in design rationale
              systems, product families, systems engineering, and ontology
              engineering has sought to capture knowledge from earlier product
              design decisions, from the breakdown of product functions and
              associated physical features, and from customer requirements and
              feedback reports. VR (Virtual reality) systems and
              multidisciplinary modeling have enabled the simulation of
              scenarios in the manufacture, assembly, and use of the product.
              This has helped capture vital knowledge from these stages of the
              product life and use it in design validation and testing. While
              there have been considerable and significant developments in
              knowledge capture and representation in product design, it is
              useful to sometimes review our position in the area, study the
              evolution of research in product design, and from past and
              current trends, try and foresee future developments. The goal of
              this paper is thus to review both our understanding of the field
              and the support tools that exist for the purpose, and identify

              have repeatedly promoted the evolution of multicellular organisms

              organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and
              coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral
              unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular
              organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic
              conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own
              increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular
              organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps
              the most important being development from a unicell, which
              minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and
              redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular
              individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck,
              defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of
              the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises
              through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular
              organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more
              opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages.
              Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular

               of images in a variety of styles, ranging from line drawing and
               pen-and-ink to oil painting and watercolour. These algorithms
               provide greater flexibility, control and automation over
               traditional drawing and painting. Despite significant progress
               over the past 15 years, the application of NPR to the generation
               of stylized animations remains an active area of research. The
               main challenge of computer-generated stylized animations is to
               reproduce the look of traditional drawings and paintings while
               minimizing distracting flickering and sliding artefacts present
               in hand-drawn animations. These goals are inherently conflicting
               and any attempt to address the temporal coherence of stylized
               animations is a trade-off. This state-of-the-art report is
               motivated by the growing number of methods proposed in recent
               years and the need for a comprehensive analysis of the
               trade-offs they propose. We formalize the problem of temporal
               coherence in terms of goals and compare existing methods
               accordingly. We propose an analysis for both line and region
               stylization methods and discuss initial steps towards their
               perceptual evaluation. The goal of our report is to help
               uninformed readers to choose the method that best suits their

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggest that mechanical feedback
                 could coordinate morphogenetic events in embryos. Furthermore,
                 embryonic tissues have complex structure and composition and
                 undergo large deformations during morphogenesis. Hence we
                 expect highly non-linear and loading-rate dependent tissue
                 mechanical properties in embryos. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
                 FINDINGS: We used micro-aspiration to test whether a simple
                 linear viscoelastic model was sufficient to describe the
                 mechanical behavior of gastrula stage Xenopus laevis embryonic
                 tissue in vivo. We tested whether these embryonic tissues
                 change their mechanical properties in response to mechanical
                 stimuli but found no evidence of changes in the viscoelastic
                 properties of the tissue in response to stress or stress
                 application rate. We used this model to test hypotheses about
                 the pattern of force generation during electrically induced
                 tissue contractions. The dependence of contractions on suction
                 pressure was most consistent with apical tension, and was
                 inconsistent with isotropic contraction. Finally, stiffer
                 clutches generated stronger contractions, suggesting that
                 force generation and stiffness may be coupled in the embryo.
                 CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The mechanical behavior of a
                 complex, active embryonic tissue can be surprisingly well
                 described by a simple linear viscoelastic model with power law
                 creep compliance, even at high deformations. We found no
                 evidence of mechanical feedback in this system. Together these
                 results show that very simple mechanical models can be useful
                 in describing embryo mechanics.",

              stipple illustration. Our method addresses directional stippling,
              where the collective flows of dots are directed parallel and/or
              orthogonal to the local feature orientations. To facilitate
              regular and directional spacing of dots, we introduce the notion
              of a structure grid, which is extracted from the smoothed feature
              orientation field. We represent a structure grid as a 2D texture
              and develop an efficient construction algorithm that outperforms
              conventional Lloyd’s method in terms of the rigor of dot
              alignment. Moreover, the criss-crossing nature of a structure
              grid allows for the inclusion of line primitives, providing
              effective description of dark tone. Given a structure grid, we
              determine the appropriate positions and attributes of primitives

                   discontinuities but performs conspicuously worse at strong

                   feedback-induced instability develops if too much artificial

              to serve lognormal distribution, which is strongly inherited by

                 and positioning of lateral organ initiation, which is a
                 fundamental aspect of plant architecture. Although important
                 progress has been made in elucidating the role of auxin
                 transport in the vegetative shoot to explain the phyllotaxis
                 of leaf formation in a spiral fashion, a model study of the
                 role of auxin transport in whorled organ patterning in the
                 expanding floral meristem is not available yet. We present an
                 initial simulation approach to study the mechanisms that are
                 expected to play an important role. Starting point is a
                 confocal imaging study of Arabidopsis floral meristems at
                 consecutive time points during flower development. These
                 images reveal auxin accumulation patterns at the positions of
                 the organs, which strongly suggests that the role of auxin in
                 the floral meristem is similar to the role it plays in the
                 shoot apical meristem. This is the basis for a simulation
                 study of auxin transport through a growing floral meristem,
                 which may answer the question whether auxin transport can in
                 itself be responsible for the typical whorled floral pattern.
                 We combined a cellular growth model for the meristem with a
                 polar auxin transport model. The model predicts that sepals
                 are initiated by auxin maxima arising early during meristem
                 outgrowth. These form a pre-pattern relative to which a series
                 of smaller auxin maxima are positioned, which partially
                 overlap with the anlagen of petals, stamens, and carpels. We
                 adjusted the model parameters corresponding to properties of
                 floral mutants and found that the model predictions agree with
                 the observed mutant patterns. The predicted timing of the
                 primordia outgrowth and the timing and positioning of the
                 sepal primordia show remarkable similarities with a developing
                 flower in nature.",

                   timed CCS-like process algebra using a notion of channel
                   that models naturally binding sites on the surface of

              University--NCAR Mesoscale Model tuned for the polar atmosphere.
              Beyond its basic mission of serving the USAP flight forecasters
              at McMurdo, AMPS has assisted both in emergency operations to
              save lives and in programs to explore the extreme polar
              environment. The former have included a medical evacuation from
              the South Pole and a marine rescue from the continental margin.
              The latter have included scientific field campaigns and the daily
              activities of international Antarctic forecasters and
              researchers. The AMPS program has been a success in terms of
              advancing polar mesoscale NWP, serving critical logistical
              operations of the USAP, and, most visibly, assisting in emergency
              rescue missions to save lives. The history and performance of
              AMPS are described and the successes of this unique real-time
              mesoscale modeling system in crisis support are detailed.",

                   attention to how cores fragment, and whether they form a
                   small or large number of protostars. Our simulations use the
                   Orion adaptive mesh refinement code to follow the collapse
                   from ~0.1 pc scales to ~10 AU scales, for durations that
                   cover the main fragmentation phase, using three-dimensional
                   gravito-radiation hydrodynamics. We find that for a wide
                   range of initial conditions radiation feedback from
                   accreting protostars inhibits the formation of fragments, so
                   that the vast majority of the collapsed mass accretes onto
                   one or a few objects. Most of the fragmentation that does
                   occur takes place in massive, self-shielding disks. These
                   are driven to gravitational instability by rapid accretion,
                   producing rapid mass and angular momentum transport that
                   allows most of the gas to accrete onto the central star
                   rather than forming fragments. In contrast, a control run
                   using the same initial conditions but an isothermal equation
                   of state produces much more fragmentation, both in and out
                   of the disk. We conclude that massive cores with observed
                   properties are not likely to fragment into many stars, so
                   that, at least at high masses, the core mass function
                   probably determines the stellar initial mass function. Our
                   results also demonstrate that simulations of massive star
                   forming regions that do not include radiative transfer, and
                   instead rely on a barotropic equation of state or optically
                   thin heating and cooling curves, are likely to produce

                 can help clarify structural features that are obscured by
                 space filling or balls and sticks style models, and recent
                 advances in programmable graphics cards offer many new
                 opportunities for improving illustrative renderings. RESULTS:
                 The ProteinShader program, a new tool for macromolecular
                 visualization, uses information from Protein Data Bank files
                 to produce illustrative renderings of proteins that
                 approximate what an artist might create by hand using pen and
                 ink. A combination of Hermite and spherical linear
                 interpolation is used to draw smooth, gradually rotating
                 three-dimensional tubes and ribbons with a repeating pattern
                 of texture coordinates, which allows the application of
                 texture mapping, real-time halftoning, and smooth edge lines.
                 This free platform-independent open-source program is written
                 primarily in Java, but also makes extensive use of the OpenGL
                 Shading Language to modify the graphics pipeline. CONCLUSION:
                 By programming to the graphics processor unit, ProteinShader
                 is able to produce high quality images and illustrative
                 rendering effects in real-time. The main feature that
                 distinguishes ProteinShader from other free molecular
                 visualization tools is its use of texture mapping techniques
                 that allow two-dimensional images to be mapped onto the curved
                 three-dimensional surfaces of ribbons and tubes with minimum
                 distortion of the images.",

                 emissions and the associated concerns about climate change
                 have motivated new ideas about carbon-constrained energy
                 production. One technological approach to control carbon
                 dioxide emissions is carbon capture and storage, or CCS. The
                 underlying idea of CCS is to capture the carbon before it
                 emitted to the atmosphere and store it somewhere other than
                 the atmosphere. Currently, the most attractive option for
                 large-scale storage is in deep geological formations,
                 including deep saline aquifers. Many physical and chemical
                 processes can affect the fate of the injected CO2, with the
                 overall mathematical description of the complete system
                 becoming very complex. Our approach to the problem has been to
                 reduce complexity as much as possible, so that we can focus on
                 the few truly important questions about the injected CO2, most
                 of which involve leakage out of the injection formation.
                 Toward this end, we have established a set of simplifying
                 assumptions that allow us to derive simplified models, which
                 can be solved numerically or, for the most simplified cases,
                 analytically. These simplified models allow calculation of
                 solutions to large-scale injection and leakage problems in
                 ways that traditional multicomponent multiphase simulators
                 cannot. Such simplified models provide important tools for
                 system analysis, screening calculations, and overall
                 risk-assessment calculations. We believe this is a practical
                 and important approach to model geological storage of carbon
                 dioxide. It also serves as an example of how complex systems
                 can be simplified while retaining the essential physics of the
                 problem.",

                   of polymer networks. These forces are transmitted to the

              elasticity is replaced by an integral operator that sums internal
              forces separated by a finite distance. This integral operator is
              not a function of the deformation gradient, allowing for a more

              landmarks of vertebrates. How this structure develops and how it
              has evolved in the different vertebrate lineages is, however, a
              matter of debate. Vertebrae and vertebral structures are derived
              from the embryonic somites, although the mechanisms of
              development are different between lineages.DISCUSSION:Using the
              anecdotal description of a teratological newt (Triturus
              dobrogicus) with an unusual malformation in its axial skeleton,
              we review, compare, and discuss the development of vertebral
              structures and, in particular, the development of centra from
              somitic cellular domains in different vertebrate groups.
              Vertebrae development through re-segmentation of the somitic
              sclerotomal cells is considered the general mechanism among
              vertebrates, which has been generalized from studies in amniotic
              model organisms. The prevalence of this mechanism among
              anamniotes is, however, controversial. We propose alternative
              developmental mechanisms for vertebrae formation that should be
              experimentally tested.SUMMARY:Research in model organisms,
              especially amniotes, is laying the foundations for a thorough
              understanding of the mechanisms of development of the axial
              skeleton in vertebrates, foundations that should expand the
              extent of future comparative studies. Although immersed in the

              organismal approach in evolutionary developmental biology for a
              better understanding of the causal role of development in the

                   This fact is a support for a known method to calculate the

                 proved very useful as models for developmental processes. The

                 mathematical and computational modeling since it has been the
                 subject of hundreds of experimental studies, and its normal
                 and variant morphologies and spatiotemporal organization of
                 expressed genes are well known. Because of its stereotypical
                 proximodistally generated increase in the number of parallel
                 skeletal elements, the limb lends itself to being modeled by
                 Turing-type systems which are capable of producing periodic,
                 or quasiperiodic, arrangements of spot- and stripe-like
                 elements. This chapter describes several such models,
                 including, (i) a system of partial differential equations in
                 which changing cell density enters into the dynamics
                 explicitly, (ii) a model for morphogen dynamics alone, derived
                 from the latter system in the ``morphostatic limit'' where
                 cell movement relaxes on a much slower time-scale than cell
                 differentiation, (iii) a discrete stochastic model for the
                 simplified pattern formation that occurs when limb cells are
                 placed in planar culture, and (iv) several hybrid models in
                 which continuum morphogen systems interact with cells
                 represented as energy-minimizing mesoscopic entities. Progress
                 in devising computational methods for handling 3D, multiscale,

                 discuss how to use structural information from detailed models
                 (or experiments) to construct coarse-grained ones in a
                 hierarchical and systematic way. This is discussed in the
                 context of the so-called Henderson theorem and the inverse
                 Monte Carlo method of Lyubartsev and Laaksonen. In the second
                 part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing
                 conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of
                 self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach.
                 Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the
                 relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues
                 related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
                 method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse
                 Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD
                 thermostat. In the final part we focus on solvent-free
                 modeling which offers a different route to coarse graining by

               complexity of shape structure is found in plant communities.
               Level of detail (LOD) of plant geometric models becomes
               important for interactive forest rendering. We emphasize three
               major problems in current research: the time consumption in LOD
               model construction and extraction, the balance between visual
               effect and data compression, and the time consumption in the
               communication between Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics
               Processing Unit (GPU). We present a new foliage simplification
               framework for LOD model and forest rendering. By an uneven
               subdivision of the tree crown volume, the cost for LOD model
               construction is drastically reduced. With a GPU-oriented design
               of LOD storage structure for foliage, the costly hierarchical
               traversal of a binary tree is replaced by a sequential lookup of
               an array. The structure also decreases the communication between
               the CPU and the GPU in rendering. In addition, Leaf density is
               introduced to adapt compression to the local distribution of
               leaves, so that more visually relevant details are kept.
               According to foliage nature (broad leaves or needles), higher
               compression are finally reached using mixed polygon/line models.
               This framework is implemented on virtual scenes of simulated
               trees with high detail. Copyright \copyright{} 2009 John Wiley

                 reef ecosystems are a lack of information on the spatial
                 distribution of marine species and a paucity of data on the
                 interacting environmental variables that drive distributional
                 patterns. Advances in marine remote sensing, together with the
                 novel integration of landscape ecology and advanced niche
                 modelling techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to
                 reliably model and map marine species distributions across
                 many kilometres of coral reef ecosystems. We developed a
                 multi-scale approach using three-dimensional seafloor
                 morphology and across-shelf location to predict spatial
                 distributions for five common Caribbean fish species. Seascape
                 topography was quantified from high resolution bathymetry at
                 five spatial scales (5-300 m radii) surrounding fish survey
                 sites. Model performance and map accuracy was assessed for two
                 high performing machine-learning algorithms: Boosted
                 Regression Trees (BRT) and Maximum Entropy Species
                 Distribution Modelling (MaxEnt). The three most important
                 predictors were geographical location across the shelf,
                 followed by a measure of topographic complexity. Predictor
                 contribution differed among species, yet rarely changed across
                 spatial scales. BRT provided 'outstanding' model predictions
                 (AUC = >0.9) for three of five fish species. MaxEnt provided
                 'outstanding' model predictions for two of five species, with
                 the remaining three models considered 'excellent' (AUC =
                 0.8-0.9). In contrast, MaxEnt spatial predictions were
                 markedly more accurate (92\% map accuracy) than BRT (68\% map
                 accuracy). We demonstrate that reliable spatial predictions
                 for a range of key fish species can be achieved by modelling
                 the interaction between the geographical location across the
                 shelf and the topographic heterogeneity of seafloor structure.
                 This multi-scale, analytic approach is an important new
                 cost-effective tool to accurately delineate essential fish
                 habitat and support conservation prioritization in marine

                 planar. Through a complex series of folds, this flat geometry
                 is transformed into the intricate three-dimensional structure
                 of the developing organism. Formation of the head fold (HF) is
                 the first step in this cascading sequence of out-of-plane
                 tissue folds. The HF establishes the anterior extent of the
                 embryo and initiates heart, foregut and brain development.
                 Here, we use a combination of computational modeling and
                 experiments to determine the physical forces that drive HF
                 formation. Using chick embryos cultured ex ovo, we measured:
                 (1) changes in tissue morphology in living embryos using
                 optical coherence tomography (OCT); (2) morphogenetic strains
                 (deformations) through the tracking of tissue labels; and (3)
                 regional tissue stresses using changes in the geometry of
                 circular wounds punched through the blastoderm. To determine
                 the physical mechanisms that generate the HF, we created a
                 three-dimensional computational model of the early embryo,
                 consisting of pseudoelastic plates representing the blastoderm
                 and vitelline membrane. Based on previous experimental
                 findings, we simulated the following morphogenetic mechanisms:
                 (1) convergent extension in the neural plate (NP); (2) cell
                 wedging along the anterior NP border; and (3) autonomous
                 in-plane deformations outside the NP. Our numerical
                 predictions agree relatively well with the observed
                 morphology, as well as with our measured stress and strain
                 distributions. The model also predicts the abnormal tissue
                 geometries produced when development is mechanically
                 perturbed. Taken together, the results suggest that the
                 proposed morphogenetic mechanisms provide the main

               off-line and real-time applications. We achieve this by using
               density based surface tracking with a novel, unconditionally
               stable, conservative advection scheme and a novel interface
               sharpening method. While our approach conserves mass, volume
               loss is still possible but only temporarily. With constant mass,
               local volume loss causes a local increase of the density used
               for surface tracking which we detect and correct over time. We
               also propose a density post-processing method to reveal sub-grid
               details of the liquid surface.We show the effectiveness of the
               proposed method in several practical examples all running either
               at interactive rates or in real-time.",

                 high-resolution electron microscopy images. Our architecture
                 scales to dense, anisotropic petascale volumes because it: (1)
                 decouples construction of the 3D multi-resolution
                 representation required for visualization from data
                 acquisition, and (2) decouples sample access time during
                 ray-casting from the size of the multi-resolution hierarchy.
                 Our system is designed around a scalable multi-resolution
                 virtual memory architecture that handles missing data
                 naturally, does not pre-compute any 3D multi-resolution
                 representation such as an octree, and can accept a constant
                 stream of 2D image tiles from the microscopes. A novelty of
                 our system design is that it is visualization-driven: we
                 restrict most computations to the visible volume data.
                 Leveraging the virtual memory architecture, missing data are
                 detected during volume ray-casting as cache misses, which are
                 propagated backwards for on-demand out-of-core processing. 3D
                 blocks of volume data are only constructed from 2D microscope
                 image tiles when they have actually been accessed during
                 ray-casting. We extensively evaluate our system design choices
                 with respect to scalability and performance, compare to
                 previous best-of-breed systems, and illustrate the

               tourist information, and disaster management. In general,
               homogeneous graphic styles are used for visualization. For
               instance, photorealism is suitable for detailed presentations,
               and non-photorealism or abstract stylization is used to
               facilitate guidance of a viewer's gaze to prioritized
               information. However, to adapt visualization to different

               visualization based on user interaction or dynamically changing
               thematic information, a combination of different graphic styles

              hatching renderings based on hand-drawn examples. We aim to
              overcome the regular and synthetic appearance of the results of
              existing methods by incorporating human virtuosity and
              illustration skills in the computer generation of such imagery.
              To achieve this goal, we propose to integrate an automatic style
              transfer with user interactions. This approach leverages the
              potential of example-based hatching while giving users the
              control and creative freedom to enhance the aesthetic appearance
              of the results. Using a scanned-in hatching illustration as
              input, we use image processing and machine learning methods to
              learn a model of the drawing style in the example illustration.
              We then apply this model to semi-automatically synthesize
              hatching illustrations of 3D meshes in the learned drawing style.
              In the learning stage, we first establish an analytical
              description of the hand-drawn example illustration using image
              processing. A 3D scene registered with the example drawing allows
              us to infer object-space information related to the 2D drawing
              elements. We employ a hierarchical style transfer model that
              captures drawing characteristics on four levels of abstraction,
              which are global, patch, stroke, and pixel levels. In the
              synthesis stage, an explicit representation of hatching strokes
              and hatching patches enables us to synthesize the learned
              hierarchical drawing characteristics. Our representation makes it
              possible to directly and intuitively interact with the hatching
              illustration. Amongst other interactions, users of our system can
              brush with patches of hatching strokes onto a 3D mesh. This
              interaction capability allows illustrators who are working with
              our system to make use of their artistic skills. Furthermore, the
              proposed interactions allow people without a background in
              hatching to interactively generate visually appealing hatching

                   We can find the relation between the chart $x^j$ and a

                 at atomic resolution and the remaining part at a reduced,
                 coarse-grained, level offer a powerful way to combine the
                 accuracy associated with the atomistic force fields to the
                 sampling speed obtained with coarse-grained (CG) potentials.
                 In this work we introduce a straightforward scheme to perform
                 hybrid simulations, making use of virtual sites to couple the
                 two levels of resolution. With the help of these virtual sites
                 interactions between molecules at different levels of
                 resolution, i.e. between CG and atomistic molecules, are
                 treated the same way as the pure CG-CG interactions. To test
                 our method, we combine the Gromos atomistic force field with a
                 number of coarse-grained potentials, obtained through several
                 approaches that are designed to obtain CG potentials based on
                 an existing atomistic model, namely iterative Boltzmann
                 inversion, force matching, and a potential of mean force
                 subtraction procedure (SB). We also explore the use of the
                 MARTINI force field for the CG potential. A simple system,
                 consisting of atomistic butane molecules dissolved in CG
                 butane, is used to study the performance of our hybrid scheme.
                 Based on the potentials of mean force for atomistic butane in
                 CG solvent, and the properties of 1:1 mixtures of atomistic
                 and CG butane which should exhibit ideal mixing behavior, we
                 conclude that the MARTINI and SB potentials are particularly
                 suited to be combined with the atomistic force field. The
                 MARTINI potential is subsequently used to perform hybrid
                 simulations of atomistic dialanine peptides in both CG butane
                 and water. Compared to a fully atomistic description of the
                 system, the hybrid description gives similar results provided
                 that the dielectric screening of water is accounted for.
                 Within the field of biomolecules, our method appears ideally
                 suited to study e.g. protein-ligand binding, where the active
                 site and ligand are modeled in atomistic detail and the rest
                 of the protein, together with the solvent, is coarse-grained.",

               explorative study (N = 16), we investigated the allocation of
               visual attention (as assessed by gaze data) on external
               representations, its relation to learning and learners' beliefs
               on the representations' functions. Results confirmed that
               students were not aware of the functions. In a subsequent
               experiment (N = 30), we analysed effects of informing students
               about the function of diagrams in worked examples on learning,
               mediating effects of visual attention and moderating effects of
               prior knowledge. The instruction had strong effects on learning,
               which were partially mediated by visual attention. Prior
               knowledge moderated both, the effects of the instruction on

               the production pipeline of computer generated motion picture.
               Motion picture production pipelines impose special functional
               and quality requirements. From the functional point of view, the
               stages of modeling, 3D rendering, and compositing form a
               pipeline without feed-back, and frames are rendered
               independently, possibly on different computers. Thus, no
               temporal data can be shared between them while flicker free
               animation needs to be generated. Quality requirements can be
               grasped as that of dual consistency: the generated hatching must
               consistently follow object movement and deformation, and, at the
               same time, it should have a consistent pattern and density in
               image-space to provide the hand-crafted look. In order to meet
               both requirements, we apply a particle based method and develop
               an image-space density control mechanism using rejection
               sampling and low-discrepancy sequences. We also discuss the
               decomposition of rendering tasks according to the main stages of

                 motility effects. Simulations of the emerging system of
                 stochastic differential equations for position and velocity of
                 cell centers show the feasibility of this Voronoi method
                 generating realistic cell shapes. In the limiting case of a
                 single cell pair in brief contact, the dynamical nonlinear
                 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is analytically investigated. In
                 general, topologically distinct tissue conformations are
                 observed, exhibiting stability on different time scales, and
                 tissue coherence is quantified by suitable characteristics.
                 Finally, an argument is derived pointing to a tradeoff in
                 natural tissues between cell size heterogeneity and the
                 extension of cellular lamellae.",

               Voronoi diagram (GVD) for higher-order sites, such as line
               segments and curves. This problem has applications in many
               fields, including computer animation, pattern recognition and so
               on. A number of methods have been proposed that use the GPU to
               speed up the computation of the GVD. The jump flooding algorithm
               (to be called JFA) is such an efficient GPU-based method that is
               particularly suitable for computing the ordinary Voronoi diagram
               of point sites. We improve the jump flooding algorithm and apply
               it to computing the GVD. Specifically, instead of directly
               propagating the complete information of a site (i.e. the
               coordinates or other geometric parameters) as in the original
               JFA, we store the site information in a 1-D texture, and
               propagate only the IDs, which are short integers, of the sites
               in another 2D texture to generate the Voronoi diagram. This
               simple strategy avoids storing redundant data and leads to
               considerately more accurate computation of the GVD with much
               less memory than using the original JFA, with only moderate
               increase of the running time.",

  abstract      = "We investigate the physical properties of molecular hydrogen
                   (H2) in isolated and interacting disk galaxies with
                   different masses and Hubble types by using chemodynamical
                   simulations with H2 formation on dust grains and dust growth
                   and destruction in interstellar medium (ISM). We
                   particularly focus on the dependences of H2 gas mass
                   fractions (f\_H2), spatial distributions of HI and H2, and
                   local H2-scaling relations on initial halo masses (M\_h),
                   baryonic fractions (f\_bary), gas mass fractions (f\_g), and
                   Hubble types. The principal results are as follows. The
                   final f\_H2 can be larger in disk galaxies with higher M\_h,
                   f\_bary, and f\_g. Some low-mass disk models with M\_h
                   smaller than 10^10 M\_sun show extremely low f\_H2 and thus
                   no/little star formation, even if initial f\_g is quite
                   large (>0.9). Big galactic bulges can severely suppress the
                   formation of H2 from HI on dust grains whereas strong
                   stellar bars can not only enhance f\_H2 but also be
                   responsible for the formation of H2-dominated central rings.
                   The projected radial distributions of H2 are significantly
                   more compact than those of HI and the simulated radial
                   profiles of H2-to-HI-ratios (R\_mol) follow roughly R^-1.5
                   in MW-type disk models. Galaxy interaction can significantly
                   increase f\_H2 and total H2 mass in disk galaxies. The local
                   surface mass densities of H2 can be correlated with those of
                   dust in a galaxy. The observed correlation between R\_mol
                   and gas pressure (R\_mol ~ P\_g^0.92) can be well reproduced

              geologists and geomorphologists, employs the parsimonious use of
              linework to represent surface structure in a straightforward and
              intuitive manner. Under the rubric of non-photorealistic
              rendering (NPR), automated procedures in this vein render
              silhouettes and creases to represent, respectively,
              view-dependent and view-independent landscape features. This
              article presents two algorithms and implementations for rendering
              silhouettes from adaptive tessellations of point-normal (PN)
              triangles at speeds approaching those suitable for animation. PN
              triangles use cubic polynomial models to provide a surface that
              appears smooth at any required resolution. The first algorithm,
              drawing on standard silhouette detection techniques in surface
              meshes, builds object space facet adjacencies and image space
              pixel adjacencies in the graphics pipeline following adaptive
              tessellation. The second makes exclusive use of image space
              analysis without referencing the underlying scene world geometry.
              Other than initial pre-processing operations, recent advances in
              the OpenGL API allow implementations for both algorithms to be

              eliminating slowdowns through data transfer across the system

                 and the behaviors exhibited by those cells shape the
                 developing embryo; however, there is a fundamental gap between
                 understanding the molecular pathways that control processes

  abstract    = "In this paper, we examine the possibilities of using voxel
                 representations as a generic way for expressing complex and
                 feature-rich geometry on current and future GPUs. We present
                 in detail a compact data structure for storing voxels and an
                 efficient algorithm for performing ray casts using this
                 structure. We augment the voxel data with novel contour
                 information that increases geometric resolution, allows more
                 compact encoding of smooth surfaces, and accelerates ray
                 casts. We also employ a novel normal compression format for
                 storing high-precision object-space normals. Finally, we
                 present a variable-radius postprocess filtering technique for
                 smoothing out blockiness caused by discrete sampling of
                 shading attributes. Based on benchmark results, we show that
                 our voxel representation is competitive with triangle-based
                 representations in terms of ray casting performance, while
                 allowing tremendously greater geometric detail and unique

               tracts in the form of surfaces of the brain, the skull, or other
               objects such as tumors. These contextual surfaces are derived

               In addition, we provide context through cutting planes onto

              properties of particulate/granular matter---a state of matter
              that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The macroscopic
              behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions
              between individual particles as well as interactions with
              surrounding fluids. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in

              truly interdisciplinary research into particulate matter and
              producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be
              effectively achieved via particle scale research based on
              detailed microdynamic information such as the forces acting on
              and trajectories of individual particles in a considered system.
              In recent years, such research has been rapidly developed
              worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of
              discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology.
              This paper reviews the work in this area with special reference

              focusing cognitive activity on schema acquisition is briefly
              summarized. It is pointed out that cognitive load theory deals
              with learning and problem solving difficulty that is artificial
              in that it can be manipulated by instructional design. Intrinsic
              cognitive load in contrast, is constant for a given area because
              it is a basic component of the material. Intrinsic cognitive load
              is characterized in terms of element interactivity. The elements
              of most schemas must be learned simultaneously because they
              interact and it is the interaction that is critical. If, as in
              some areas, interactions between many elements must be learned,
              then intrinsic cognitive load will be high. In contrast, in
              different areas, if elements can be learned successively rather
              than simultaneously because they do not interact, intrinsic
              cognitive load will be low. It is suggested that extraneous
              cognitive load that interferes with learning only is a problem
              under conditions of high cognitive load caused by high element
              interactivity. Under conditions of low element interactivity,
              re-designing instruction to reduce extraneous cognitive load may
              have no appreciable consequences. In addition, the concept of
              element interactivity can be used to explain not only why some
              material is difficult to learn but also, why it can be difficult
              to understand. Understanding becomes relevant when high element
              interactivity material with a naturally high cognitive load must
              be learned.",

                 mechanisms by which stem cells maintain their capacity to
                 regenerate, yet at the same time produce daughter cells that
                 differentiate and attain their ultimate fate as a functional
                 part of a tissue or an organ. In this paper we propose that,
                 during development, cells within growing organs obtain
                 positional information from a macroscopic physical field that
                 is produced in space while cells are proliferating. This
                 dynamical interaction triggers and responds to chemical and
                 genetic processes that are specific to each biological system.
                 We chose the root apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana to
                 develop our dynamical model because this system is well
                 studied at the molecular, genetic and cellular levels and has
                 the key traits of multicellular stem-cell niches. We built a
                 dynamical model that couples fundamental molecular mechanisms
                 of the cell cycle to a tension physical field and to auxin
                 dynamics, both of which are known to play a role in root
                 development. We perform extensive numerical calculations that
                 allow for quantitative comparison with experimental
                 measurements that consider the cellular patterns at the root

  abstract = "Abstract A key factor limiting the reliability of simulations of
              anthropogenic climate change is the inability to accurately
              represent the various effects of clouds on climate. Despite the
              best efforts of the community, the problem has resisted solution
              for several decades. The reasons for this are briefly reviewed
              and it is argued that it will be many more decades before the
              problem can be solved through the approaches to cloud
              parameterization that have been used up to now. An alternative
              approach, called superparameterization, is then outlined, in
              which high-resolution cloud system--resolving models (CSRMs) are
              used in place of the conventional cloud parameterizations. Tests
              performed with the Community Atmosphere Model show that
              superparameterizations can give more realistic simulations of the
              current climate, including greatly improved simulations of the
              Madden--Julian oscillation and other tropical wave disturbances.
              Superparameterizations increase the cost of climate simulation by
              a factor of several hundred dollars, but can make efficient use
              of massively parallel computers. In addition,
              superparameterizations make it possible for a climate model to
              converge to a global CSRM as the horizontal grid spacing of the
              climate model decreases to a few kilometers. No existing global
              atmospheric model has this convergence property.

              are characterised by interactions involving different scales at

              macroscopic behaviour (at organ and tissue scale) and
              microstructure (at cell scale) strongly influence each other.
              Consequently, several approaches have been defined to model such
              a process at different spatial and temporal levels and, in
              particular, in terms of continuum properties, abstracting in this

              While a large amount of information is available to validate such

              fully in a faithful multiscale model. In this scenario, we

                 limb development concern how the numbers of skeletal elements
                 along the proximodistal (P-D) and anteroposterior (A-P) axes
                 are determined and how the shape of a growing limb affects
                 skeletal element formation. There is currently no generally
                 accepted model for these patterning processes, but recent work
                 on cartilage development (chondrogenesis) indicates that
                 precartilage tissue self-organizes into nodular patterns by
                 cell-molecular circuitry with local auto-activating and
                 lateral inhibitory (LALI) properties. This process is played
                 out in the developing limb in the context of a gradient of
                 fibroblast growth factor (FGF) emanating from the apical
                 ectodermal ridge (AER). RESULTS: We have simulated the
                 behavior of the core chondrogenic mechanism of the developing
                 limb in the presence of an FGF gradient using a novel
                 computational environment that permits simulation of LALI
                 systems in domains of varying shape and size. The model
                 predicts the normal proximodistal pattern of skeletogenesis as
                 well as distal truncations resulting from AER removal.
                 Modifications of the model's parameters corresponding to
                 plausible effects of Hox proteins and formins, and of the
                 reshaping of the model limb, bud yielded simulated phenotypes
                 resembling mutational and experimental variants of the limb.
                 Hypothetical developmental scenarios reproduce skeletal
                 morphologies with features of fossil limbs. CONCLUSIONS: The
                 limb chondrogenic regulatory system operating in the presence
                 of a gradient has an inherent, robust propensity to form
                 limb-like skeletal structures. The bare bones framework can
                 accommodate ancillary gene regulatory networks controlling
                 limb bud shaping and establishment of Hox expression domains.
                 This mechanism accounts for major features of the normal limb
                 pattern and, under variant geometries and different parameter
                 values, those of experimentally manipulated, genetically

              have evolved from a range of ideas and solutions that are
              reflective of their original problem domains. As a result,
              research in MS science has followed widely diverse and disjoint
              paths, which present a barrier to cross pollination of ideas and
              application of methods outside their application domains. The
              status of the research environment calls for a methodological
              framework able to (i) provide a common language to modelling and
              simulating MS problems across a range of scientific and
              engineering disciplines and, consequently, (ii) characterize
              critical common issues arising in MS problems in an uniform
              setting. In this paper, we contribute in this sense. Taking
              inspiration from the Complex Automata (CxA) MS approach, we
              formally define and enrich the meta-model of BioShape -- put
              forward as a scale-independent MS simulation environment -- and
              we exploit it to give a uniform treatment of generally defined
              coupling schemes, in particular the micro-macro one applied to
              the bone remodelling process. Similarly to CxA, also the BioShape
              meta-model enjoys two important features: namely, (i) a MS system
              can be decomposed in uniform single-scale models, each one
              described by a generic sequence of calls to well-defined
              operators, and (ii) the link between any two single-scale models
              can be expressed as a flow of data between a pair of these
              operators by well-defined coupling schemes. As a consequence,
              such features not only enforce and formally prove the
              scale-independence property of the BioShape simulator, but also
              makes the BioShape meta-model a common and uniform MS modelling

              as molecules, cells and tissues, while two algebraic operators,
              both symmetric, define composition of processes within and
              between scales. Composed actions allow for biological events to
              interact within and between scales at the same time. The algebra
              has a stochastic semantics based on functional rates of
              reactions. Two bisimulations are defined on PAH processes. The
              first bisimulation is used to aid model development by checking
              that two biological scales can interact correctly. The second
              bisimulation is a congruence that relates models, or part of
              models, that can perform the same timed events at a specified
              scale. Finally, we provide a PAH model of pattern formation in a

                 are the Hill-type muscle models, which have been incorporated
                 into rigid-body modeling frameworks, and three-dimensional
                 continuum-mechanical models. Biophysically based models
                 attempt to predict the muscle's response as emerging from the
                 underlying physiology of the system. In this contribution, the
                 conventional biophysically based modeling methodology is
                 extended to include several structural and functional
                 characteristics of skeletal muscle. The result is a
                 physiologically based, multi-scale skeletal muscle finite
                 element model that is capable of representing detailed,
                 geometrical descriptions of skeletal muscle fibers and their
                 grouping. Together with a well-established model of motor-unit
                 recruitment, the electro-physiological behavior of single
                 muscle fibers within motor units is computed and linked to a
                 continuum-mechanical constitutive law. The bridging between
                 the cellular level and the organ level has been achieved via a
                 multi-scale constitutive law and homogenization. The effect of
                 homogenization has been investigated by varying the number of
                 embedded skeletal muscle fibers and/or motor units and
                 computing the resulting exerted muscle forces while applying
                 the same excitatory input. All simulations were conducted
                 using an anatomically realistic finite element model of the
                 tibialis anterior muscle. Given the fact that the underlying
                 electro-physiological cellular muscle model is capable of
                 modeling metabolic fatigue effects such as potassium
                 accumulation in the T-tubular space and inorganic phosphate
                 build-up, the proposed framework provides a novel
                 simulation-based way to investigate muscle behavior ranging
                 from motor-unit recruitment to force generation and fatigue.",

                 properties and by the external/internal fluid and membrane
                 viscosities. We present a multiscale RBC model that is able to
                 predict RBC mechanics, rheology, and dynamics in agreement
                 with experiments. Based on an analytic theory, the modeled
                 membrane properties can be uniquely related to the
                 experimentally established RBC macroscopic properties without
                 any adjustment of parameters. The RBC linear and nonlinear
                 elastic deformations match those obtained in optical-tweezers
                 experiments. The rheological properties of the membrane are
                 compared with those obtained in optical magnetic twisting
                 cytometry, membrane thermal fluctuations, and creep followed
                 by cell recovery. The dynamics of RBCs in shear and Poiseuille
                 flows is tested against experiments and theoretical
                 predictions, and the applicability of the latter is discussed.
                 Our findings clearly indicate that a purely elastic model for
                 the membrane cannot accurately represent the RBC's rheological
                 properties and its dynamics, and therefore accurate modeling

                   3D scenes in recent years. One of the breakthroughs leading
                   to their popularity was KinectFusion, where the focus is on
                   3D reconstruction using RGB-D sensors. However, monocular
                   SLAM has since also been tackled with very similar
                   approaches. Representing the reconstruction volumetrically
                   as a truncated signed distance function leads to most of the
                   simplicity and efficiency that can be achieved with GPU
                   implementations of these systems. However, this
                   representation is also memory-intensive and limits the
                   applicability to small scale reconstructions. Several
                   avenues have been explored for overcoming this limitation.
                   With the aim of summarizing them and providing for a fast
                   and flexible 3D reconstruction pipeline, we propose a new,
                   unifying framework called InfiniTAM. The core idea is that
                   individual steps like camera tracking, scene representation
                   and integration of new data can easily be replaced and
                   adapted to the needs of the user. Along with the framework
                   we also provide a set of components for scalable
                   reconstruction: two implementations of camera trackers,
                   based on RGB data and on depth data, two representations of
                   the 3D volumetric data, a dense volume and one based on
                   hashes of subblocks, and an optional module for swapping

  abstract = "With the ever increasing costs of manual content creation for
              virtual worlds, the potential of creating it automatically
              becomes too attractive to ignore. However, for most designers,
              traditional procedural content generation methods are complex and
              unintuitive to use, hard to control, and generated results are
              not easily integrated into a complete and consistent virtual
              world. We introduce a novel declarative modeling approach that
              enables designers to concentrate on stating what they want to
              create instead of on describing how they should model it. It aims
              at reducing the complexity of virtual world modeling by combining
              the strengths of semantics-based modeling with manual and
              procedural approaches. This article describes two of its main
              contributions to procedural modeling of virtual worlds:
              interactive procedural sketching and virtual world consistency
              maintenance. We discuss how these techniques, integrated in our
              modeling framework SketchaWorld, build up to enable designers to
              create a complete 3D virtual world in minutes. Procedural
              sketching provides a fast and more intuitive way to model virtual
              worlds, by letting designers interactively sketch their virtual
              world using high-level terrain features, which are then
              procedurally expanded using a variety of integrated procedural
              methods. Consistency maintenance guarantees that the semantics of
              all terrain features is preserved throughout the modeling
              process. In particular, it automatically solves conflicts
              possibly emerging from interactions between terrain features. We
              believe that these contributions together represent a significant
              step towards providing more user control and flexibility in
              procedural modeling of virtual worlds. It can therefore be
              expected that by further reducing its complexity, virtual world
              modeling will become accessible to an increasingly broad group of
              users.",

  abstract    = "Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale
                 that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These
                 phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and
                 self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG)
                 molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on
                 length and time scales that are 2-3 orders of magnitude larger
                 compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between
                 the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG
                 model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field.
                 Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer
                 systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the
                 potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of
                 its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine
                 (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association
                 constants, the partitioning of a series of model
                 pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation of WALP23 in
                 DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in
                 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and
                 dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison
                 with results obtained from atomistic models shows good
                 agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a
                 systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of
                 polyalanine-leucine peptides (with different lengths and
                 compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of
                 peptides partitioned at the interface increased with
                 decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content,
                 demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating
                 partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the
                 amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the
                 concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by
                 magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic
                 simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In
                 conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and
                 effectively reproduces peptide-lipid interactions and the
                 partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.",

              discovery tool, ``Summon'', and whether they encountered any
              difficulties pertaining to navigation, ease of use and the
              quality of the search results.Design/methodology/approach --
              Researchers conducted a series of usability studies in which
              students were observed as they conducted some typical library
              resource searches using the new discovery search
              platform.Findings -- The paper analyses the data, describes and
              reports the findings of the usability tests. The study found that
              the new homepage design of providing a single search box was an
              effective interface for users. The students found a single search
              box discovery solution was simple to use, and seemed to deliver
              satisfactory results on a selection of typical library search
              tasks. The study confirms some of the promise for web scale
              discovery, but points to new lines of enquiry in relation to the
              nature of assistance that students will need in the future,
              particularly in relation to their need to evaluate
              information.Originality/value -- Web scale discovery searching is
              an innovation in the online searching of library collections. The

               have been made in order to develop contemporary library models
               that are often known as Library 2.0. However, little research

               participation. The research presented in this paper fills this
               gap. A grounded theory approach was adopted for this study. Six
               librarians were involved in in-depth individual interviews. As a
               preliminary result, five main factors of the participatory
               library emerged including technological, human, educational,
               social-economic, and environmental. Five factors influencing the
               participation in libraries were also identified: finance,
               technology, education, awareness, and policy. The study’s

               methodology used to gather data for the development of the
               models included written surveys, audio journals, written
               activity logs, photographs, and semistructured group interviews.
               Twenty-seven inner-city teens aged 14 through 17 participated in
               the study. Data analysis took the form of iterative pattern
               coding using QSR NVivo 2 software (QSR International, 2002). The
               resulting theoretical model includes seven areas of urban teen
               development: the social self, the emotional self, the reflective
               self, the physical self, the creative self, the cognitive self,
               and the sexual self. The researchers conclude that the essence
               of teen everyday life information seeking (ELIS) is the
               gathering and processing of information to facilitate the
               teen-to-adulthood maturation process. ELIS is self-exploration
               and world exploration that helps teens understand themselves and
               the social and physical worlds in which they live. This study

              are used for scholarly activity. It focuses on the end-users of
              e-books in a case study which aimed to establish how scholars use
              and learn from e-books and the limitations of academic e-books.
              There have been a number of calls for more user-focussed research
              on e-books to understand how they are used rather than how often
              they are used. In-depth case studies of end user behaviour are,
              by design, very labour and resource intensive and generally
              limited in terms of the numbers of participants and the ability
              to generalise from analysis of the results. However, this type of
              research provides a valuable insight into how scholars interact
              with e-books to attempt to fulfil their information needs. These
              studies produce a very rich data set which enables the researcher
              to understand how scholars use, and wish to use, e-books.
              Analysis of our empirical results, together with those obtained
              from previous research examining user needs and experiences of
              e-books, has enabled us to draw general conclusions about what is
              required in future e-book design and development. More
              specifically, we present a typology of e-book interactions
              relevant to the design of e-books (content and features) and to
              library/academic instruction in the effective use of e-books

                 search practices. We queried respondents on their searching
                 preferences, practices and use of 9 online information
                 sources. RESULTS: Respondents (n=115; 75\% response rate)
                 comprised both academic (59\%) and community-based (41\%)
                 nephrologists. Respondents were an average of 48 years old and
                 were in practice for an average of 15 years. Nephrologists
                 used a variety of online sources to retrieve information on
                 patient treatment including UpToDate (92\%), PubMed (89\%),
                 Google (76\%) and Ovid MEDLINE (55\%). Community-based
                 nephrologists were more likely to consult UpToDate first
                 (91\%), while academic nephrologists were divided between
                 UpToDate (58\%) and PubMed (41\%). When searching
                 bibliographic resources such as PubMed, 80\% of nephrologists
                 scan a maximum of 40 citations (the equivalent of 2 search
                 pages in PubMed). Searching practices did not differ by age,
                 sex or years in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrologists routinely
                 use a variety of online resources to search for information
                 for patient care. These include bibliographic databases,
                 general search engines and specialized medical resources.",

  abstract    = "INTRODUCTION: Our understanding about the role of the Internet
                 as a resource for physicians has improved in the past several
                 years with reports of patterns for use and measures of impact
                 on medical practice. The purpose of this study was to begin to
                 shape a theory base for more fully describing physicians'
                 information-seeking behaviors as they apply to Internet use
                 and applications for continuing education providers to more
                 effectively support learning. METHODS: A survey about Internet
                 use and physician information seeking was administered by
                 facsimile transmission to a random sample of 3,347 physicians.
                 RESULTS: Almost all physicians have access to the Internet,
                 and most believe it is important for patient care. The most
                 frequent use is in accessing the latest research on specific
                 topics, new information in a disease area, and information
                 related to a specific patient problem. Critical to seeking
                 clinical information is the credibility of the source,
                 followed by relevance, unlimited access, speed, and ease of
                 use. Electronic media are viewed as increasingly important
                 sources for clinical information, with decreased use of
                 journals and local continuing medical education (CME).
                 Barriers to finding needed information include too much
                 information, lack of specific information, and navigation or
                 searching difficulties. DISCUSSION: The Internet has become an
                 important force in how physicians deliver care. Understanding
                 more about physician information-seeking needs, behaviors, and
                 uses is critical to CME providers to support a self-directed
                 curriculum for each physician. A shift to increased use of
                 electronic CME options points to new demands for users and
                 providers. Specific information about how physicians create a
                 question and search for resources is an area that requires
                 providers to develop new skills.",

              librarians' attitudes on teaching and how they identify
              themselves as teachers. Particular attention is to be paid to
              teaching librarians' views on the effectiveness of two types of
              instruction models: for-credit courses and course-integrated
              library instruction. Design/methodology/approach -- To
              investigate librarians' attitudes towards these two models, a
              survey was constructed targeting librarians who teach information
              literacy (IL). Findings -- The results indicate that there is an
              important relationship between the IL instruction model employed
              and feelings towards campus politics, perceived effectiveness of
              IL models, and librarians' self-identification as teachers.
              Research limitations/implications -- The survey was sent to
              list-servs whose readership includes high percentages of teaching
              librarians and received 276 responses. This is by no means an
              exhaustive study. The research is intended to be exploratory and
              to delve more deeply than the past editorials and blog posts on
              the issue of comparing for-credit and course-integrated
              instruction. Practical implications -- This study can help
              librarians gain a better understanding of how information
              literacy models impact librarian perceptions of themselves and
              their role on campus. Originality/value -- The authors seek to

              summarizes characteristics of the next generation catalog into a
              check‐list of 12 features. This list was checked against each of
              seven open source and ten proprietary discovery tools to
              determine if those features were present or absent in those
              tools.Findings -- Discovery tools have many next generation
              catalog features, but only a few can be called real next
              generation catalogs. Federated searching and relevancy based on
              circulation statistics are the two areas that both open source

                 2003 Health Information National Trends Survey data to
                 evaluate 619 cancer survivors. RESULTS: Two-thirds (67.5\%, n
                 = 418) of the survivors sought cancer information (InfoSeek)
                 and 32.5\% (n = 201) did not (NoInfoSeek). Significant
                 predictors of cancer information seeking included age (less
                 than 65), gender (female), income (>US$ 25,000/year), and
                 having a regular health care provider (HCP). CONCLUSION: Not
                 all survivors actively look for cancer information. Although
                 most survivors prefer receiving cancer information from their
                 HCP, many turn to a variety of other sources, primarily the

                 survivors and actively refer patients to the Internet as an
                 extension of and enhancement to their patient interactions.

              evolving and generating much discussion about its nature and
              standards for its evaluation, MMR has been employed in the social
              and behavioral sciences for more than three decades. It is
              already considered the third approach to research, along with the
              quantitative and qualitative approaches. How did this approach
              shape research in LIS? An analysis of 465 articles published in
              four major LIS research journals revealed that 22 articles (5\%)
              employed MMR. However, the recognition of MMR by name or as a
              research method was absent from these articles and from the
              methodological literature in LIS. The various strengths of MMR
              suggest that being cognizant of its possible use in LIS would
              benefit researchers in the field.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: It is vital to select and process relevant
                 information while restraining irrelevant information for
                 successful retrieval. When multiple streams of information are
                 concurrently present, the ability to overcome distraction is
                 very crucial for processing relevant information. Despite its
                 significance, the neural mechanism of successful memory
                 formation under distraction remains unclear, especially with
                 memory for associations. The present fMRI study investigated
                 the effect of distraction due to irrelevant stimuli in source
                 memory. METHODS: In the MR scanner, participants studied an
                 item and perceptual context with no distractor, a
                 letter-distractor, or a word-distractor. Following the study
                 phase, a source recognition test was administered in which
                 participants were instructed to judge the study status of the
                 test items and context of studied items. Participants'
                 encoding activity was back-sorted by later source recognition
                 to find the influence of distractors in subsequent memory
                 effects. RESULTS: Source memory with distractors recruited
                 greater encoding activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
                 cortex, and the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform
                 cortex, along with the left posterior hippocampus. However,
                 enhanced activity in the left anterior ventrolateral
                 prefrontal cortex and the left parahippocampal cortex
                 predicted successful source memory regardless of the presence
                 of a distractor. CONCLUSIONS: These findings of subsequent
                 memory effects suggest that strong binding of the item-context
                 associations, as well as resistance to interference, may have
                 greater premium in the formation of successful source memory
                 of pictures under distraction. Further, attentional selection
                 to the relevant target seems to play a major role in
                 contextual binding under distraction by enhancing the
                 viability of memory representations from interference effects
                 of distractors.",

  abstract = "McCarthy's Situation Calculus is arguably the oldest
              special-purpose knowledge representation formalism, designed to
              axiomatize knowledge of actions and their effects. Four decades
              of research in this area have led to a variety of alternative
              formalisms: While some approaches can be considered instances or
              extensions of the classical Situation Calculus, like Reiter's
              successor state axioms or the Fluent Calculus, there are also
              special planning languages like ADL and approaches based on a
              linear (rather than branching) time structure like the Event
              Calculus. The co-existence of many different calculi has two main
              disadvantages: The formal relations among them is a largely open
              issue, and a lot of today's research concerns the transfer of
              specific results from one approach to another. In this paper, we
              present a unifying action calculus, which encompasses
              (well-defined classes of) all of the aforementioned formalisms.
              Our calculus not only facilitates comparisons and translations
              between specific approaches, it also allows to solve interesting
              problems for various calculi at once. We exemplify this by
              providing a general, calculus-independent solution to a problem
              of practical relevance, which is intimately related to McCarthy's
              quest for elaboration tolerant formalisms: the modularity of

                 mnemonic benefit for their relationship. A separate body of
                 literature has indicated that the presence of emotional
                 information can have an impact on the binding of associated
                 neutral details, in some cases facilitating associative
                 binding (MacKay et al. Memory and cognition 32:474-488, 2004;
                 Mather, perspectives on psychological science 2:33-52, 2007),
                 and in other cases impeding the processing of associated
                 details (Easterbrook, Psychological Review 66:183-201, 1959;
                 Kensinger, Emotion review 1:99-113, 2009). In the present
                 experiments, we investigated how memory for neutral words is
                 affected by the emotionality of the information with which
                 they are presented (whether with an emotional word or a second
                 neutral word) and the encoding context (integrated or
                 nonintegrated strategy). Participants viewed word pairs and
                 were instructed to visualize the items as an integrated unit
                 or to visualize them separately from one another. The results
                 of Experiment 1 showed a disproportionate mnemonic benefit for
                 neutral items that were integrated with other neutral items
                 over those integrated with emotional items. The results of
                 Experiments 2A and 2B showed that this effect interacted with
                 encoding time: When given 2 s to encode, participants showed
                 no effect of integration on memory for neutral-neutral pairs,
                 but showed a significant mnemonic benefit for integrating
                 emotional-neutral pairs. When given 4 or 6 s, the integrative
                 benefit increased significantly for neutral-neutral pairs but
                 decreased for emotional-neutral pairs. These results suggest
                 that creating an integrated mental image of two neutral items
                 requires a more time-consuming process than integrating an
                 emotional and a neutral item, but that extra effort may result
                 in a downstream mnemonic benefit.",

              comprehension of high-element interactive material (i.e., the
              causal relations between elements) increased only in the cueing

              the ‘notion of model’ held by a total sample of 39 science
              teachers who were: employed in ‘fundamental’ (6--14 years) and
              ‘medium’ (15--17 years) schools; student science teachers
              currently doing their practicum; and university science teachers.
              Seven ‘aspects’ of their notions of a model were identified: the
              nature of a model, the use to which it can be put, the entities
              of which it consists, its relative uniqueness, the time span over
              which it is used, its status in the making of predictions, and
              the basis for the accreditation of its existence and use.
              Categories of meaning were identified for each of these aspects.
              The profiles of teachers' notions of ‘model’ in terms of the
              aspects and categories were complex, providing no support for the
              notion of ‘Levels’ in understanding. Teachers with degrees in

              article is to establish a working definition of quantitative

              that framework. Context underlies all quantitative reasoning; for
              this review, environmental science serves as the context.In the
              framework, we identify four components of quantitative reasoning:
              the quantification act, quantitative literacy, quantitative
              interpretation of a model, and quantitative modeling. Within each
              of these components, the framework provides elements that
              comprise the four components. The quantification act includes the
              elements of variable identification, communication, context, and
              variation. Quantitative literacy includes the elements of
              numeracy, measurement, proportional reasoning, and basic
              probability/statistics. Quantitative interpretation includes the
              elements of representations, science diagrams, statistics and
              probability, and logarithmic scales. Quantitative modeling
              includes the elements of logic, problem solving, modeling, and
              inference. A brief comparison of the quantitative reasoning
              framework with the AAC\&U Quantitative Literacy VALUE rubric is

               models, but before extensive instruction or experience with

               philosophers of science, and with findings from previous
               research on students' understanding of modeling. The most
               commonly listed criteria referred to the clarity, pictorial
               form, and explanatory function of models. Almost a quarter of
               the students included criteria relating to model fit with
               evidence. Students' criteria provided insights into their
               understanding of the explanatory and descriptive goals of
               models; the constitutive, communicative, and epistemic features
               of models; and the role of evidence in supporting models.

               range of modeling ideas that can be leveraged in instruction to
               promote deeper understandings of the modeling practice. We argue

               can go some way toward addressing such problems. The evaluation
               of these interfaces, however, is challenging because they
               generally offer diverse and versatile search environments that
               introduce overwhelming amounts of independent variables to user

               elements of the practice (constructing, using, evaluating, and
               revising scientific models) and the metaknowledge that guides
               and motivates the practice (e.g., understanding the nature and
               purpose of models). Our learning progression for scientific
               modeling includes two dimensions that combine metaknowledge and
               elements of practice---scientific models as tools for predicting
               and explaining, and models change as understanding improves. We
               describe levels of progress along these two dimensions of our
               progression and illustrate them with classroom examples from 5th
               and 6th graders engaged in modeling. Our illustrations indicate
               that both groups of learners productively engaged in
               constructing and revising increasingly accurate models that
               included powerful explanatory mechanisms, and applied these
               models to make predictions for closely related phenomena.
               Furthermore, we show how students engaged in modeling practices
               move along levels of this progression. In particular, students
               moved from illustrative to explanatory models, and developed
               increasingly sophisticated views of the explanatory nature of
               models, shifting from models as correct or incorrect to models

              when people are learning complex new ideas. Unfortunately, many
              studies have shown this promise is not always achieved. The DeFT
              (Design, Functions, Tasks) framework for learning with multiple
              representations integrates research on learning, the cognitive
              science of representation and constructivist theories of
              education. It proposes that the effectiveness of multiple
              representations can best be understood by considering three
              fundamental aspects of learning: the design parameters that are
              unique to learning with multiple representations; the functions
              that multiple representations serve in supporting learning and
              the cognitive tasks that must be undertaken by a learner
              interacting with multiple representations. The utility of this

                   of a realm as a structure for consolidating knowledge about
                   a mathematical theory. A realm contains several

                   Views interconnect these developments and establish that the
                   axiomatizations are equivalent in the sense of being
                   mutually interpretable. A realm also contains an external

  abstract    = "Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were
                 inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic,
                 statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal
                 theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from
                 those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual
                 approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they
                 are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual
                 systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in
                 the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience.
                 During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain
                 capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor
                 areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas
                 partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement
                 perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual
                 symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at
                 the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use
                 of selective attention, schematic representations of
                 perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored
                 in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As
                 memories of the same component become organized around a
                 common frame, they implement a simulator that produces
                 limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of
                 purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of
                 sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of
                 proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g.,
                 compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these
                 simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents
                 types, supports categorization, and produces categorical
                 inferences. These simulators further support productivity,
                 propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a
                 fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from
                 integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to
                 produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding
                 simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token
                 relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex
                 simulations of combined physical and introspective events.
                 Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully
                 functional conceptual system while avoiding problems
                 associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for
                 cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and
                 artificial intelligence are explored.",

  title    = "Ontology-based similarity for product information retrieval",
  author   = "Akmal, Suriati and Shih, Li-Hsing and Batres, Rafael",
  abstract = "Abstract Product development of today is becoming increasingly
              knowledge intensive. Specifically, design teams face considerable
              challenges in making effective use of increasing amounts of
              information. In order to support product information retrieval
              and reuse, one approach is to use case-based reasoning (CBR) in
              which problems are solved ``by using or adapting solutions to old
              problems.'' In CBR, a case includes both a representation of the
              problem and a solution to that problem. Case-based reasoning uses
              similarity measures to identify cases which are more relevant to
              the problem to be solved. However, most non-numeric similarity
              measures are based on syntactic grounds, which often fail to
              produce good matches when confronted with the meaning associated
              to the words they compare. To overcome this limitation,
              ontologies can be used to produce similarity measures that are
              based on semantics. This paper presents an ontology-based
              approach that can determine the similarity between two classes
              using feature-based similarity measures that replace features
              with attributes. The proposed approach is evaluated against other
              existing similarities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
              approach is illustrated with a case study on

              discern what is to be learned (the object of learning).
              Discerning the object of learning amounts to discerning its
              critical aspects. To discern an aspect, the learner must
              experience potential alternatives, that is, variation in a
              dimension corresponding to that aspect, against the background of
              invariance in other aspects of the same object of learning. (One
              could not discern the color of things, for instance, if there was
              only one color.) The study results illustrate that what students
              learn in a sequence of lessons is indeed a function of the
              pattern of variation and invariance constituted in that sequence.
              All teachers make use of variation and invariance in their
              teaching, but this study shows that teachers informed by a

               learning engagement and describes the socio-cultural context of
               QA's implementation. The students and teacher were observed
               during the lessons, interviewed after, and the completed quests
               were analysed to determine the level of engagement achieved. A
               pre- and posttest on the Science concepts covered was also
               administered. A seven-level taxonomy of engagement was used to
               provide the study with a more holistic perspective of
               engagement, together with the attempt to concretise the element
               of engagement into observable traits. Although there was a
               significant improvement of the posttest over the pretest, the
               level of engagement of the students was low (between 3 and 4).
               The lack of engagement might be a result of the distractions in
               the 3D MUVE, the students’ difficulty with language used in the
               QA, their lack of computer competency for QA tasks, and/or their

              investigated potential gender differences in the game’s learning
              effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was 88
              students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which
              used the gaming application (Group A, N = 47) and the other one
              the non-gaming one (Group B, N = 41). A Computer Memory Knowledge
              Test (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were
              also observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the
              interventions, students’ views on the application they had used
              were elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses
              showed that the gaming approach was both more effective in
              promoting students’ knowledge of computer memory concepts and
              more motivational than the non-gaming approach. Despite boys’

              allow educators to actively collaborate in the educational game
              development process, using a narrative-based representation. WEEV
              is based on a pragmatic reinterpretation of previous works on
              narrativity and video games, enhanced by the use of a novel
              visual language to represent the flow of the story or narrative.
              The WEEV methodology has been implemented into an actual tool
              based on the already established platform for educational games.
              This tool was improved with feedback gathered from formative
              evaluation, end-users testing (i.e. educators), and actual use in
              the development of an educational game. The system, still under

              need for the educational effectiveness of the resulting games to
              be further analyzed. However, this paper highlights that,
              according to the qualitative results of evaluations, WEEV can
              indeed be successfully applied to simplify the game creation
              process and that by using representations of games that educators
              can understand, WEEV can help provide educational value to games.",

                 and possible solutions for future theory development. METHOD:
                 Review of the literature and theoretical analysis. RESULTS:
                 Reasoned action theories have made limited contributions to
                 the science of behaviour change as they do not propose means
                 of changing cognitions or account for existing effective
                 behaviour change techniques. Changing beliefs does not
                 guarantee behaviour change. The implementation intentions
                 (IMPs) approach to planning has advanced theorizing but the
                 applications to health behaviours often divert substantially
                 from the IMPs paradigm with regard to interventions, effects,
                 mediators and moderators. Better construct definitions and
                 differentiations are needed to make further progress in
                 integrating theory and understanding behaviour change.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Further progress in theorizing can be achieved by
                 (a) disentangling planning constructs to study their
                 independent and joint effects on behaviour, (b) progressing
                 research on moderators and mediators of planning effects

                 development and wellbeing and contrasts it with the model of
                 self-interest that is prominent in economics. The two
                 approaches have considerably different implications for how
                 human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology,
                 prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an
                 evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting
                 suites of social behavior-prosociality vs. antisocial
                 behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and
                 related problems such as depression. Prosociality of
                 individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize
                 toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly
                 reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit
                 opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit
                 of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and
                 related problems emerge in environments that are high in
                 threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials
                 have shown numerous family, school, and community
                 interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote
                 prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and
                 economic inequality are major risk factors for the development
                 of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can
                 reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is
                 clear that the canonical economic model of rational
                 self-interest has made a significant contribution to the
                 science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it
                 must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human

                 basic science of intentional change centered on evolution;
                 second, to provide examples of intentional behavioral and
                 cultural change from the applied behavioral sciences, which
                 are largely unknown to the basic sciences community. All
                 species have evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity that
                 enable them to respond adaptively to their environments. Some
                 mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity count as evolutionary
                 processes in their own right. The human capacity for symbolic
                 thought provides an inheritance system having the same kind of
                 combinatorial diversity as does genetic recombination and
                 antibody formation. Taking these propositions seriously allows
                 an integration of major traditions within the basic behavioral
                 sciences, such as behaviorism, social constructivism, social
                 psychology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary psychology,
                 which are often isolated and even conceptualized as opposed to
                 one another. The applied behavioral sciences include
                 well-validated examples of successfully managing behavioral
                 and cultural change at scales ranging from individuals to
                 small groups to large populations. However, these examples are
                 largely unknown beyond their disciplinary boundaries, for lack
                 of a unifying theoretical framework. Viewed from an
                 evolutionary perspective, they are examples of managing
                 evolved mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity, including
                 open-ended processes of variation and selection. Once the many
                 branches of the basic and applied behavioral sciences become
                 conceptually unified, we are closer to a science of
                 intentional change than one might think.",

                 divergence in reaction norm shapes between populations and
                 closely related species is one approach to providing insights.
                 Here we use a meta-analytic approach to compare divergence in
                 reaction norms of closely related species or populations of
                 animals and plants across types of traits and environments. We
                 quantified mean-standardized differences in overall trait
                 means (Offset) and reaction norm shape (including both Slope
                 and Curvature). These analyses revealed that differences in
                 shape (Slope and Curvature together) were generally greater
                 than differences in Offset. Additionally, differences in
                 Curvature were generally greater than differences in Slope.
                 The type of taxon contrast (species vs. population), trait,
                 organism, and the type and novelty of environments all
                 contributed to the best-fitting models, especially for Offset,
                 Curvature, and the total differences (Total) between reaction
                 norms. Congeneric species had greater differences in reaction
                 norms than populations, and novel environmental conditions
                 increased the differences in reaction norms between
                 populations or species. These results show that evolutionary
                 divergence of curvature is common and should be considered an
                 important aspect of plasticity, together with slope.
                 Biological details about traits and environments, including
                 cryptic variation expressed in novel environmental conditions,
                 may be critical to understanding how reaction norms evolve in
                 novel and rapidly changing environments.",

  abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a survey on zoning methods for
              handwritten character recognition. Through the analysis of the
              relevant literature in the field, the most valuable zoning
              methods are presented in terms of both topologies and membership
              functions. Throughout the paper, diverse zoning topologies are
              presented based on both static and adaptive approaches.
              Concerning static approaches, uniform and non-uniform zoning
              strategies are discussed. When adaptive zonings are considered,
              manual and automatic strategies for optimal zoning design are
              illustrated as well as the most appropriate zoning representation
              techniques. In addition, the role of membership functions for
              zoning-based classification is highlighted and the diverse
              approaches to membership function selection are presented.
              Concerning global membership functions, the paper introduces
              order-based approaches as well as fuzzy approaches using
              border-based and ranked-based fuzzy membership values. Concerning
              local membership functions, the recent parameter-based approaches
              are described, in which the optimal membership-function is
              selected for each zone of the zoning method. Finally, a

               for historical handwritten document images. We considered layout
               analysis as a pixel labeling problem. By classifying each pixel
               as either periphery, background, text block, or decoration, we
               achieve high quality segmentation without any assumption of
               specific topologies and shapes. Various color and texture
               features such as color variance, smoothness, Laplacian, Local
               Binary Patterns, and Gabor Dominant Orientation Histogram are
               used for classification. Some of these features have so far not
               got many attentions for document image layout analysis. By
               applying an Improved Fast Correlation-Based Filter feature
               selection algorithm, the redundant and irrelevant features are
               removed. Finally, the segmentation results are refined by a
               smoothing post-processing procedure. The proposed method is
               demonstrated by experiments conducted on three different
               historical handwritten document image datasets. Experiments show
               the benefit of combining various color and texture features for
               classification. The results also show the advantage of using a
               feature selection method to choose optimal feature subset. By
               applying the proposed method we achieve superior accuracy
               compared with earlier work on several datasets, e.g., We
               achieved 93\% accuracy compared with 91\% of the previous method

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the most
                 commonly used file format for online scientific publications.
                 The absence of effective means to extract text from these PDF
                 files in a layout-aware manner presents a significant
                 challenge for developers of biomedical text mining or
                 biocuration informatics systems that use published literature
                 as an information source. In this paper we introduce the
                 'Layout-Aware PDF Text Extraction' (LA-PDFText) system to
                 facilitate accurate extraction of text from PDF files of
                 research articles for use in text mining applications.
                 RESULTS: Our paper describes the construction and performance
                 of an open source system that extracts text blocks from
                 PDF-formatted full-text research articles and classifies them
                 into logical units based on rules that characterize specific
                 sections. The LA-PDFText system focuses only on the textual
                 content of the research articles and is meant as a baseline
                 for further experiments into more advanced extraction methods
                 that handle multi-modal content, such as images and graphs.
                 The system works in a three-stage process: (1) Detecting
                 contiguous text blocks using spatial layout processing to
                 locate and identify blocks of contiguous text, (2) Classifying
                 text blocks into rhetorical categories using a rule-based
                 method and (3) Stitching classified text blocks together in
                 the correct order resulting in the extraction of text from
                 section-wise grouped blocks. We show that our system can
                 identify text blocks and classify them into rhetorical
                 categories with Precision1 = 0.96\% Recall = 0.89\% and F1 =
                 0.91\%. We also present an evaluation of the accuracy of the
                 block detection algorithm used in step 2. Additionally, we
                 have compared the accuracy of the text extracted by LA-PDFText
                 to the text from the Open Access subset of PubMed Central. We
                 then compared this accuracy with that of the text extracted by
                 the PDF2Text system, 2commonly used to extract text from PDF.
                 Finally, we discuss preliminary error analysis for our system
                 and identify further areas of improvement. CONCLUSIONS:
                 LA-PDFText is an open-source tool for accurately extracting
                 text from full-text scientific articles. The release of the
                 system is available at http://code.google.com/p/lapdftext/.",

              scanned into a document format, such as the Portable Document
              Format (PDF), and easily emailed to recipients around the world.
              Upon the document’s arrival, the receiver can open and view it
              using a vast array of different PDF viewing applications such as
              Adobe Reader and Apple Preview. Hence, today the use of the PDF
              has become pervasive. Since the scanned PDF is an image format,
              it is inaccessible to assistive technologies such as a screen
              reader. Therefore, the retrieval of the information needs Optical
              Character Recognition (OCR). The OCR software scans the scanned
              PDF file and through text extraction generates an editable text
              formatted document. This text document can then be edited,
              formatted, searched and indexed as well as translated or
              converted to speech. A problem that the OCR software does not
              solve is the accurate regeneration of the full text layout. This
              paper presents a technology that addresses this issue by closely
              preserving the original textual layout of the scanned PDF using
              the open source document analysis and OCR system (OCRopus) based
              on geometric layout and positioning information. The main issues
              considered in this research are the preservation of the correct

              developed a method that uses iRods rules and a Jython script to
              automate the extraction of metadata from digital archaeological
              data. The first step was to create a record-keeping system to
              classify the data. The record-keeping system employs file and
              directory hierarchy naming conventions designed specifically to
              maintain the relationship between the data objects and map the
              archaeological documentation process. The metadata implicit in
              the record-keeping system is automatically extracted upon ingest,
              combined with additional sources of metadata, and stored
              alongside the data in the iRods preservation environment. This
              method enables a more organized workflow for the researchers,
              helps them archive their data close to the moment of data
              creation, and avoids error prone manual metadata input. We

              illustrated documents, based on analysis at five levels: content
              structure, rhetorical structure, layout structure, navigation
              structure, and linguistic structure. We also include three
              sources of constraints under which a document might be produced
              and interpreted: canvas constraints, production constraints, and
              consumption constraints. Document genres are conceptualised as
              complex specifications composed of descriptions at each of the
              five levels that conform in characteristic ways to the three
              kinds of constraint. We propose that the eight parameters

              fact that it is possible for new genres to develop at different

                 songs scored in 6/8 or 3/4 meter. Participants matched

  abstract = "Data schema transformations occur in the context of software
              evolution, refactoring, and cross-paradigm data mappings. When
              constraints exist on the initial schema, these need to be
              transformed into constraints on the target schema. Moreover, when
              high-level data types are refined to lower level structures,
              additional target schema constraints must be introduced to
              balance the loss of structure and preserve semantics. We
              introduce an algebraic approach to schema transformation that is
              constraint-aware in the sense that constraints are preserved from
              source to target schemas and that new constraints are introduced
              where needed. Our approach is based on refinement theory and
              point-free program transformation. Data refinements are modeled
              as rewrite rules on types that carry point-free predicates as
              constraints. At each rewrite step, the predicate on the reduct is
              computed from the predicate on the redex. An additional rewrite
              system on point-free functions is used to normalize the
              predicates that are built up along rewrite chains. We implemented
              our rewrite systems in a type-safe way in the functional
              programming language Haskell. We demonstrate their application to
              constraint-aware hierarchical-relational mappings.",

               entry forms present the first and arguably best opportunity for
               detecting and mitigating errors, but there has been little
               research into automatic methods for improving data quality at
               entry time. In this paper, we propose USHER, an end-to-end
               system for form design, entry, and data quality assurance. Using
               previous form submissions, USHER learns a probabilistic model
               over the questions of the form. USHER then applies this model at
               every step of the data entry process to improve data quality.
               Before entry, it induces a form layout that captures the most
               important data values of a form instance as quickly as possible.
               During entry, it dynamically adapts the form to the values being
               entered, and enables real-time feedback to guide the data
               enterer toward their intended values. After entry, it re-asks
               questions that it deems likely to have been entered incorrectly.
               We evaluate all three components of USHER using two real-world
               data sets. Our results demonstrate that each component has the
               potential to improve data quality considerably, at a reduced

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Poor usability is one of the major barriers for
                 optimally using electronic health records (EHRs). Dentists are
                 increasingly adopting EHRs, and are using structured data
                 entry interfaces to enter data such that the data can be
                 easily retrieved and exchanged. Until recently, dentists have
                 lacked a standardized terminology to consistently represent
                 oral health diagnoses. OBJECTIVES: In this study we evaluated
                 the usability of a widely used EHR interface that allow the
                 entry of diagnostic terms, using multi-faceted methods to
                 identify problems and work with the vendor to correct them
                 using an iterative design method. METHODS: Fieldwork was
                 undertaken at two clinical sites, and dental providers as
                 subjects participated in user testing (n=32), interviews
                 (n=36) and observations (n=24). RESULTS: User testing revealed
                 that only 22-41\% of users were able to successfully complete
                 a simple task of entering one diagnosis, while no user was
                 able to complete a more complex task. We identified and
                 characterized 24 high-level usability problems reducing
                 efficiency and causing user errors. Interface-related problems
                 included unexpected approaches for displaying diagnosis, lack
                 of visibility, and inconsistent use of UI widgets. Terminology
                 related issues included missing and mis-categorized concepts.
                 Work domain issues involved both absent and superfluous
                 functions. In collaboration with the vendor, each usability
                 problem was prioritized and a timeline set to resolve the
                 concerns. DISCUSSION: Mixed methods evaluations identified a
                 number of critical usability issues relating to the user
                 interface, underlying terminology of the work domain. The
                 usability challenges were found to prevent most users from
                 successfully completing the tasks. Our further work we will
                 determine if changes to the interface, terminology and work
                 domain do result in improved usability.",

                 as there is increasing emphasis on good data collection for
                 surgical patients with cancer, and numerous overlapping
                 systems that are amassing data on the same patients. METHODS:
                 Links have been established between pathological databases,
                 multidisciplinary team data-collection systems and
                 patient-survival monitoring facilities, providing accurate
                 pathology, treatment and survival data on all of uro-oncology
                 patients. We are also developing individual modules for the
                 oncological surgeons within our unit that are compatible with
                 the British Association of Urological Surgeons (Section of
                 Oncology), and have plans to connect to the Medical and
                 Clinical Oncology data systems in the future. RESULTS:
                 Pre-existing protocols for fresh tissue, plasma and urine
                 collection have been incorporated within CRUD via a
                 tissue-tracking system, to comply with the Human Tissue Act
                 2004, and link these samples to accurate clinical,
                 pathological and survival data. Many research and audit
                 projects have already used these data, including the
                 construction of a 274-case tissue microarray for renal cell
                 carcinoma, microRNA hybridization arrays and analysis of 900
                 nephrectomy cases from the past three decades. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our work over the past 3 years in Oxford has established
                 numerous links with organizations collecting data on our
                 uro-oncological patients, and we are now able to collect this

              many ecologists now capture data electronically in the field,
              while avoiding transcription errors found in more traditional
              field notebook or slate-based approaches of recording data.
              Ecologists either use simple forms from generic handheld software
              that doesn’t allow for needed optimizations, or else they must
              spend substantial effort in the design and optimization of
              handheld software user interfaces. These efforts often produce
              highly customized software that is not easily repurposed, and
              that produce non-standard, undocumented data formats. Our
              research is focused on reducing this effort by providing a
              flexible framework that uses highly structured metadata to drive
              the generation of customized data entry interfaces. Our approach
              relies on formalized metadata encoded in either XML Schema or XML
              instance documents, which facilitate the creation of graphical
              interfaces from arbitrary data schemas. Specifically, we leverage
              the rich metadata descriptions and structures found in the
              Ecological Metadata Language to create data entry forms, and
              output data sets that adhere to this specification. The
              interfaces are refined by using data-typing and domain
              information found in the structured metadata to generate
              validation routines that assist in maintaining data integrity
              during the entry process. The framework utilizes a rule-based
              engine to promote both reuse and extensibility of the modules
              that are created for any given data entry effort. Interfaces are
              rendered using open, Internet-based standards to maintain
              portability and to advocate the sharing of software components.
              The framework represents an initial implementation of a
              customizable user interface generator, which should have broad
              applicability to researchers in need of rapidly creating field

                 accented temporal events, has a remarkable capacity to move
                 our minds and bodies. How does the cognitive system enable our
                 experiences of rhythmically complex music? In this paper, we
                 describe some common forms of rhythmic complexity in music and
                 propose the theory of predictive coding (PC) as a framework
                 for understanding how rhythm and rhythmic complexity are
                 processed in the brain. We also consider why we feel so
                 compelled by rhythmic tension in music. First, we consider
                 theories of rhythm and meter perception, which provide
                 hierarchical and computational approaches to modeling. Second,
                 we present the theory of PC, which posits a hierarchical
                 organization of brain responses reflecting fundamental,
                 survival-related mechanisms associated with predicting future
                 events. According to this theory, perception and learning is
                 manifested through the brain's Bayesian minimization of the
                 error between the input to the brain and the brain's prior
                 expectations. Third, we develop a PC model of musical rhythm,
                 in which rhythm perception is conceptualized as an interaction
                 between what is heard (``rhythm'') and the brain's
                 anticipatory structuring of music (``meter''). Finally, we
                 review empirical studies of the neural and behavioral effects
                 of syncopation, polyrhythm and groove, and propose how these
                 studies can be seen as special cases of the PC theory. We
                 argue that musical rhythm exploits the brain's general
                 principles of prediction and propose that pleasure and desire
                 for sensorimotor synchronization from musical rhythm may be a
                 result of such mechanisms.",

                 ways, music and animal songs are more comparable to each other
                 than to language as propositional semantics cannot be used as
                 indicator of communicative success or wellformedness, and
                 notions of grammaticality are less easily defined. This review
                 brings together accounts of the principles of structure
                 building in music and animal song. It relates them to
                 corresponding models in formal language theory, the extended
                 Chomsky hierarchy (CH), and their probabilistic counterparts.
                 We further discuss common misunderstandings and shortcomings
                 concerning the CH and suggest ways to move beyond. We discuss
                 language, music and animal song in the context of their
                 function and motivation and further integrate problems and
                 issues that are less commonly addressed in the context of
                 language, including continuous event spaces, features of sound
                 and timbre, representation of temporality and interactions of
                 multiple parallel feature streams. We discuss these aspects in

                 and modelling research in the domains of music, language and

  abstract = "The goal of user experience design in industry is to improve
              customer satisfaction and loyalty through the utility, ease of
              use, and pleasure provided in the interaction with a product. So
              far, user experience studies have mostly focused on short-term
              evaluations and consequently on aspects relating to the initial
              adoption of new product designs. Nevertheless, the relationship
              between the user and the product evolves over long periods of
              time and the relevance of prolonged use for market success has
              been recently highlighted. In this paper, we argue for the
              cost-effective elicitation of longitudinal user experience data.
              We propose a method called the ``UX Curve'' which aims at
              assisting users in retrospectively reporting how and why their
              experience with a product has changed over time. The usefulness
              of the UX Curve method was assessed in a qualitative study with
              20 mobile phone users. In particular, we investigated how users’
              specific memories of their experiences with their mobile phones
              guide their behavior and their willingness to recommend the
              product to others. The results suggest that the UX Curve method
              enables users and researchers to determine the quality of
              long-term user experience and the influences that improve user
              experience over time or cause it to deteriorate. The method
              provided rich qualitative data and we found that an improving
              trend of perceived attractiveness of mobile phones was related to
              user satisfaction and willingness to recommend their phone to
              friends. This highlights that sustaining perceived attractiveness
              can be a differentiating factor in the user acceptance of
              personal interactive products such as mobile phones. The study
              suggests that the proposed method can be used as a
              straightforward tool for understanding the reasons why user
              experience improves or worsens in long-term product use and how
              these reasons relate to customer loyalty.",

                 that the origins of musicality--the capacity that makes it
                 possible for us to perceive, appreciate and produce music--can
                 be pursued productively by searching for components of
                 musicality in other species. Recent studies have highlighted
                 that the behavioural relevance of stimuli to animals and the
                 relation of experimental procedures to their natural behaviour
                 can have a large impact on the type of results that can be
                 obtained for a given species. Through reviewing laboratory
                 findings on animal auditory perception and behaviour, as well

                 that both traditional laboratory studies and studies relating

                 musicality. Traditional laboratory studies use synthetic
                 stimuli that provide more control than more naturalistic
                 studies, and are in many ways suitable to test the perceptual
                 abilities of animals. However, naturalistic studies are
                 essential to inform us as to what might constitute relevant

                 we may or may not expect certain stimulus manipulations to be

                 represents a cognitively complex and biologically grounded
                 capacity worthy of intensive empirical investigation. Four
                 principles are suggested here as prerequisites for a
                 successful future discipline of bio-musicology. These involve
                 adopting: (i) a multicomponent approach which recognizes that
                 musicality is built upon a suite of interconnected capacities,
                 of which none is primary; (ii) a pluralistic Tinbergian
                 perspective that addresses and places equal weight on
                 questions of mechanism, ontogeny, phylogeny and function;
                 (iii) a comparative approach, which seeks and investigates
                 animal homologues or analogues of specific components of
                 musicality, wherever they can be found; and (iv) an
                 ecologically motivated perspective, which recognizes the need
                 to study widespread musical behaviours across a range of human
                 cultures (and not focus solely on Western art music or skilled
                 musicians). Given their pervasiveness, dance and music created
                 for dancing should be considered central subcomponents of
                 music, as should folk tunes, work songs, lullabies and
                 children's songs. Although the precise breakdown of capacities
                 required by the multicomponent approach remains open to
                 debate, and different breakdowns may be appropriate to
                 different purposes, I highlight four core components of human
                 musicality--song, drumming, social synchronization and
                 dance--as widespread and pervasive human abilities spanning
                 across cultures, ages and levels of expertise. Each of these
                 has interesting parallels in the animal kingdom (often
                 analogies but in some cases apparent homologies also).
                 Finally, I suggest that the search for universal capacities
                 underlying human musicality, neglected for many years, should
                 be renewed. The broad framework presented here illustrates the
                 potential for a future discipline of bio-musicology as a rich

                 genes provides new entry points for deciphering the key
                 neurobiological pathways. In the past decade, the search for
                 genetic correlates of musicality has gained traction. Reports
                 have documented familial clustering for different extremes of
                 ability, including amusia and absolute pitch (AP), with twin
                 studies demonstrating high heritability for some music-related
                 skills, such as pitch perception. Certain chromosomal regions
                 have been linked to AP and musical aptitude, while individual
                 candidate genes have been investigated in relation to aptitude
                 and creativity. Most recently, researchers in this field
                 started performing genome-wide association scans. Thus far,
                 studies have been hampered by relatively small sample sizes

              research in and experiences from a large number of software

              and evaluated in a case study and modified accordingly. These

              evaluate a development process or develop systems development

  abstract = "This article considers the problematic relationship between new
              media designers and users in current texts written about
              user-centered design (UCD) techniques. To better understand and
              solidify the importance of the user within the technological
              artifact, these designers often create ‘personas’ ---
              prototypical users with names, faces, interests and preferences.
              Personas serve as boundary objects used as conceptual stand-ins
              for users when team members make design decisions. This article
              traces the discursive construction of the ‘user’ within web
              design texts and how these texts describe the persona technique.
              The analysis suggests that the use of personas is motivated as
              much by political realities within new media organizations, as it
              is by the desire to address user needs. In addition, it is argued
              that personas serve to reinscribe the conceptual separation
              between the user and designer despite technological developments
              (like Web 2.0) that blur this boundary.",

              major research topic as technology becomes more ubiquitous in the
              home. Research is being carried out in numerous areas to assist
              with cooking, from solving difficulties in the kitchen to more
              recently enhancing already good experiences related to cooking.
              To design solutions that are not only usable, but useful in all
              related aspects of cooking, we must get a good understanding of
              the needs of the user. It is important that real needs are
              identified, so that products or systems designed are adopted and
              are sustainable. There are various methods that researchers and
              designers use to gain user insights and there is much debate on
              different approaches and their effectiveness. Whilst there have
              been a number of ethnographic style studies in people's homes,
              there has been little in the way of understanding user goals in
              the kitchen which could lead to more effective design solutions.
              In this paper, we present goal-directed research of cooking needs
              in Singapore. We produce three primary design personas and three
              secondary personas, describing their goals and needs and where
              they can be helped through technology. An online survey was
              carried out to validate our personas, comparing our qualitative
              and quantitative findings. We provide a general holistic overview
              of kitchen requirements for these personas, whether in helping

  abstract    = "Music is often studied as a cognitive domain alongside
                 language. The emotional aspects of music have also been shown
                 to be important, but views on their nature diverge. For
                 instance, the specific emotions that music induces and how
                 they relate to emotional expression are still under debate.
                 Here we propose a mental and neural chronometry of the
                 aesthetic experience of music initiated and mediated by
                 external and internal contexts such as intentionality,
                 background mood, attention, and expertise. The initial stages
                 necessary for an aesthetic experience of music are feature
                 analysis, integration across modalities, and cognitive
                 processing on the basis of long-term knowledge. These stages
                 are common to individuals belonging to the same musical
                 culture. The initial emotional reactions to music include the
                 startle reflex, core ``liking,'' and arousal. Subsequently,
                 discrete emotions are perceived and induced. Presumably
                 somatomotor processes synchronizing the body with the music
                 also come into play here. The subsequent stages, in which
                 cognitive, affective, and decisional processes intermingle,
                 require controlled cross-modal neural processes to result in
                 aesthetic emotions, aesthetic judgments, and conscious liking.
                 These latter aesthetic stages often require attention,
                 intentionality, and expertise for their full actualization.",

  abstract    = "Tension and suspense are powerful emotional experiences that
                 occur in a wide variety of contexts (e.g., in music, film,
                 literature, and everyday life). The omnipresence of tension
                 and suspense suggests that they build on very basic cognitive
                 and affective mechanisms. However, the psychological
                 underpinnings of tension experiences remain largely
                 unexplained, and tension and suspense are rarely discussed
                 from a general, domain-independent perspective. In this paper,
                 we argue that tension experiences in different contexts (e.g.,
                 musical tension or suspense in a movie) build on the same
                 underlying psychological processes. We discuss key components
                 of tension experiences and propose a domain-independent model
                 of tension and suspense. According to this model, tension
                 experiences originate from states of conflict, instability,
                 dissonance, or uncertainty that trigger predictive processes
                 directed at future events of emotional significance. We also
                 discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying tension and
                 suspense. The model provides a theoretical framework that can

                 scholars have proposed numerous functions that listening to
                 music might fulfill. However, different theoretical
                 approaches, different methods, and different samples have left
                 a heterogeneous picture regarding the number and nature of
                 musical functions. Moreover, there remains no agreement about
                 the underlying dimensions of these functions. Part one of the
                 paper reviews the research contributions that have explicitly
                 referred to musical functions. It is concluded that a
                 comprehensive investigation addressing the basic dimensions
                 underlying the plethora of functions of music listening is
                 warranted. Part two of the paper presents an empirical
                 investigation of hundreds of functions that could be extracted
                 from the reviewed contributions. These functions were
                 distilled to 129 non-redundant functions that were then rated
                 by 834 respondents. Principal component analysis suggested
                 three distinct underlying dimensions: People listen to music
                 to regulate arousal and mood, to achieve self-awareness, and
                 as an expression of social relatedness. The first and second
                 dimensions were judged to be much more important than the
                 third-a result that contrasts with the idea that music has
                 evolved primarily as a means for social cohesion and
                 communication. The implications of these results are discussed
                 in light of theories on the origin and the functionality of
                 music listening and also for the application of musical

  abstract    = "Despite widespread support from policy makers, funding
                 agencies, and scientific journals, academic researchers rarely
                 make their research data available to others. At the same
                 time, data sharing in research is attributed a vast potential
                 for scientific progress. It allows the reproducibility of
                 study results and the reuse of old data for new research
                 questions. Based on a systematic review of 98 scholarly papers
                 and an empirical survey among 603 secondary data users, we
                 develop a conceptual framework that explains the process of
                 data sharing from the primary researcher's point of view. We
                 show that this process can be divided into six descriptive
                 categories: Data donor, research organization, research
                 community, norms, data infrastructure, and data recipients.
                 Drawing from our findings, we discuss theoretical implications
                 regarding knowledge creation and dissemination as well as
                 research policy measures to foster academic collaboration. We
                 conclude that research data cannot be regarded as knowledge
                 commons, but research policies that better incentivise data
                 sharing are needed to improve the quality of research results

  abstract    = "Being ``in flow'' or ``in the zone'' is defined as an
                 extremely focused state of consciousness which occurs during
                 intense engagement in an activity. In general, flow has been
                 linked to peak performances (high achievement) and feelings of
                 intense pleasure and happiness. However, empirical research on
                 flow in music performance is scarce, although it may offer
                 novel insights into the question of why musicians engage in
                 musical activities for extensive periods of time. Here, we
                 focused on individual differences in a group of 76 piano
                 performance students and assessed their flow experience in
                 piano performance as well as their trait emotional
                 intelligence. Multiple regression analysis revealed that flow
                 was predicted by the amount of daily practice and trait
                 emotional intelligence. Other background variables (gender,
                 age, duration of piano training and age of first piano
                 training) were not predictive. To predict high achievement in
                 piano performance (i.e., winning a prize in a piano
                 competition), a seven-predictor logistic regression model was
                 fitted to the data, and we found that the odds of winning a
                 prize in a piano competition were predicted by the amount of
                 daily practice and the age at which piano training began.
                 Interestingly, a positive relationship between flow and high
                 achievement was not supported. Further, we explored the role
                 of musical emotions and musical styles in the induction of
                 flow by a self-developed questionnaire. Results suggest that
                 besides individual differences among pianists, specific
                 structural and compositional features of musical pieces and
                 related emotional expressions may facilitate flow experiences.
                 Altogether, these findings highlight the role of emotion in
                 the experience of flow during music performance and call for
                 further experiments addressing emotion in relation to the
                 performer and the music alike.",

                 motor processes while engaging with music (referred to as
                 sensorimotor coupling) in a seemingly effortless way, is
                 commonly described as the feeling of being in the groove.
                 Here, we systematically explore this compelling phenomenon in
                 a population of young adults. We utilize multiple levels of
                 analysis, comprising phenomenological, behavioral, and
                 computational techniques. Specifically, we show (a) that the
                 concept of the groove is widely appreciated and understood in
                 terms of a pleasurable drive toward action, (b) that a broad
                 range of musical excerpts can be appraised reliably for the
                 degree of perceived groove, (c) that the degree of experienced
                 groove is inversely related to experienced difficulty of
                 bimanual sensorimotor coupling under tapping regimes with
                 varying levels of expressive constraint, (d) that high-groove
                 stimuli elicit spontaneous rhythmic movements, and (e) that
                 quantifiable measures of the quality of sensorimotor coupling
                 predict the degree of experienced groove. Our results
                 complement traditional discourse regarding the groove, which
                 has tended to take the psychological phenomenon for granted
                 and has focused instead on the musical and especially the
                 rhythmic qualities of particular genres of music that lead to
                 the perception of groove. We conclude that groove can be
                 treated as a psychological construct and model system that
                 allows for experimental exploration of the relationship
                 between sensorimotor coupling with music and emotion.",

                 prognosis could greatly improve care through personalization
                 of treatment. Computational analyses of genome-wide expression
                 datasets have identified such signatures, but these signatures
                 leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy,
                 reproducibility, and biological interpretability. Methods that
                 take advantage of structured prior knowledge (eg, protein
                 interaction networks) show promise in helping to define better
                 signatures, but most knowledge remains unstructured.
                 Crowdsourcing via scientific discovery games is an emerging
                 methodology that has the potential to tap into human
                 intelligence at scales and in modes unheard of before.
                 OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to test the
                 hypothesis that knowledge linking expression patterns of
                 specific genes to breast cancer outcomes could be captured
                 from players of an open, Web-based game. We envisioned
                 capturing knowledge both from the player's prior experience
                 and from their ability to interpret text related to candidate
                 genes presented to them in the context of the game. METHODS:
                 We developed and evaluated an online game called The Cure that
                 captured information from players regarding genes for use as
                 predictors of breast cancer survival. Information gathered
                 from game play was aggregated using a voting approach, and
                 used to create rankings of genes. The top genes from these
                 rankings were evaluated using annotation enrichment analysis,
                 comparison to prior predictor gene sets, and by using them to
                 train and test machine learning systems for predicting 10 year
                 survival. RESULTS: Between its launch in September 2012 and
                 September 2013, The Cure attracted more than 1000 registered
                 players, who collectively played nearly 10,000 games. Gene
                 sets assembled through aggregation of the collected data
                 showed significant enrichment for genes known to be related to
                 key concepts such as cancer, disease progression, and
                 recurrence. In terms of the predictive accuracy of models
                 trained using this information, these gene sets provided
                 comparable performance to gene sets generated using other
                 methods, including those used in commercial tests. The Cure is
                 available on the Internet. CONCLUSIONS: The principal
                 contribution of this work is to show that crowdsourcing games
                 can be developed as a means to address problems involving
                 domain knowledge. While most prior work on scientific
                 discovery games and crowdsourcing in general takes as a
                 premise that contributors have little or no expertise, here we
                 demonstrated a crowdsourcing system that succeeded in
                 capturing expert knowledge.",

                 has been disputed for decades and has never been empirically
                 demonstrated. Here we combine a music-classification scheme
                 with statistical analyses, including phylogenetic comparative
                 methods, to examine a well-sampled global set of 304 music
                 recordings. Our analyses reveal no absolute universals but
                 strong support for many statistical universals that are
                 consistent across all nine geographic regions sampled. These
                 universals include 18 musical features that are common
                 individually as well as a network of 10 features that are
                 commonly associated with one another. They span not only
                 features related to pitch and rhythm that are often cited as
                 putative universals but also rarely cited domains including
                 performance style and social context. These cross-cultural
                 structural regularities of human music may relate to roles in
                 facilitating group coordination and cohesion, as exemplified
                 by the universal tendency to sing, play percussion
                 instruments, and dance to simple, repetitive music in groups.
                 Our findings highlight the need for scientists studying music
                 evolution to expand the range of musical cultures and musical
                 features under consideration. The statistical universals we
                 identified represent important candidates for future
                 investigation.",

              EOL, a compelling example of a content curation community, and
              describe a case study of EOL based on analysis of interviews,

                 two cultures. Two identical experiments were conducted: the
                 first in the Congolese rainforest with an isolated population
                 of Mebenz\'{e}l\'{e} Pygmies without any exposure to Western
                 music and culture, the second with a group of Western music
                 listeners, with no experience with Congolese music. Forty
                 Pygmies and 40 Canadians listened in pairs to 19 music
                 excerpts of 29-99 s in duration in random order (eight from
                 the Pygmy population and 11 Western instrumental excerpts).
                 For both groups, emotion components were continuously
                 measured: subjective feeling (using a two- dimensional valence
                 and arousal rating interface), peripheral physiological
                 activation, and facial expression. While Pygmy music was rated
                 as positive and arousing by Pygmies, ratings of Western music
                 by Westerners covered the range from arousing to calming and
                 from positive to negative. Comparing psychophysiological
                 responses to emotional qualities of Pygmy music across
                 participant groups showed no similarities. However, Western
                 stimuli, rated as high and low arousing by Canadians, created
                 similar responses in both participant groups (with high
                 arousal associated with increases in subjective and
                 physiological activation). Several low-level acoustical
                 features of the music presented (tempo, pitch, and timbre)
                 were shown to affect subjective and physiological arousal
                 similarly in both cultures. Results suggest that while the
                 subjective dimension of emotional valence might be mediated by
                 cultural learning, changes in arousal might involve a more
                 basic, universal response to low-level acoustical
                 characteristics of music.",

              the popularity and scope of citizen science appears almost
              limitless. For citizens the motivation is to contribute to
              ``real'' science, public information and conservation. For
              scientists, citizen science offers a way to collect information
              that would otherwise not be affordable. The longest running and
              largest of these citizen science programs are broad-scale bird
              monitoring projects. There are two basic types of protocols
              possible: (a) cross-sectional schemes such as Atlases --
              collections of surveys of many species contributed by volunteers
              over a set period of time, and (b) longitudinal schemes such as
              Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS) -- on-going stratified monitoring of
              sites that require more coordination. We review recent
              applications of these citizen science programs to determine their
              influence in the scientific literature. We use
              return-on-investment thinking to identify the minimum investment
              needed for different citizen science programs, and the point at
              which investing more in citizen science programs has diminishing
              benefits. Atlas and BBS datasets are used to achieve different
              objectives, with more knowledge-focused applications for Atlases
              compared with more management applications for BBS. Estimates of
              volunteer investment in these datasets show that compared to
              cross-sectional schemes, longitudinal schemes are more
              cost-effective, with increased BBS investment correlated with
              more applications, which have higher impact in the scientific
              literature, as measured by citation rates. This is most likely
              because BBS focus on measuring change, allowing the impact of
              management and policy to be quantified. To ensure both types of
              data are used to their full potential we recommend the following:
              elements of BBS protocols (fixed sites, long-term monitoring) are
              incorporated into Atlases; regional coordinators are in place to
              maintain data quality; communication between researchers and the
              organisations coordinating volunteer monitoring is enhanced, with
              monitoring targeted to meet specific needs and objectives;
              application of data to under-explored objectives is encouraged,
              and data are made freely and easily accessible.",

                   crowdsourcing contests. Crowdsourcing contests can be
                   modeled as all-pay auctions because entrants must exert
                   effort up-front to enter. Unlike all-pay auctions where a
                   usual design objective would be to maximize revenue, in
                   crowdsourcing contests, the principal only benefits from the
                   submission with the highest quality. We give a theory for
                   optimal crowdsourcing contests that mirrors the theory of
                   optimal auction design: the optimal crowdsourcing contest is
                   a virtual valuation optimizer (the virtual valuation
                   function depends on the distribution of contestant skills

                   relatively disadvantaged because the effort of losing
                   contestants is wasted. Nonetheless, we show that
                   crowdsourcing contests are 2-approximations to conventional

                 here I propose a comprehensive hypothesis on the origins and
                 evolution of music, dance, and speech from a biological and
                 sociological perspective. I suggest that every pitch interval
                 between neighboring notes in music represents corresponding
                 movement pattern through interpreting the Doppler effect of
                 sound, which not only provides a possible explanation for the
                 transposition invariance of music, but also integrates music
                 and dance into a common form-rhythmic movements. Accordingly,
                 investigating the origins of music poses the question: why do
                 humans appreciate rhythmic movements? I suggest that human
                 appreciation of rhythmic movements and rhythmic events
                 developed from the natural selection of organisms adapting to
                 the internal and external rhythmic environments. The
                 perception and production of, as well as synchronization with
                 external and internal rhythms are so vital for an organism's
                 survival and reproduction, that animals have a rhythm-related
                 reward and emotion (RRRE) system. The RRRE system enables the
                 appreciation of rhythmic movements and events, and is integral
                 to the origination of music, dance and speech. The first type
                 of rewards and emotions (rhythm-related rewards and emotions,
                 RRREs) are evoked by music and dance, and have biological and
                 social functions, which in turn, promote the evolution of
                 music, dance and speech. These functions also evoke a second
                 type of rewards and emotions, which I name society-related
                 rewards and emotions (SRREs). The neural circuits of RRREs and
                 SRREs develop in species formation and personal growth, with
                 congenital and acquired characteristics, respectively, namely
                 music is the combination of nature and culture. This
                 hypothesis provides probable selection pressures and outlines
                 the evolution of music, dance, and speech. The links between
                 the Doppler effect and the RRREs and SRREs can be empirically
                 tested, making the current hypothesis scientifically concrete.",

  abstract  = "1. Volunteers have helped in scientific surveys of birds and
               other organisms for decades, but more recently, the use of the
               Internet has enormously widened the opportunity for citizen
               science and greatly increased its practice. There is now a need
               to share experience of which methods work and which do not.
               Here, we describe how we planned and executed the Evolution
               MegaLab, one of the largest surveys of polymorphism in wild
               species so far undertaken. 2. The aim of the Evolution MegaLab
               was to exploit the occasion of Charles Darwin’s double centenary
               in 2009 to mobilize the widest possible section of the general
               public in Europe to help survey shell polymorphism in the banded
               snails Cepaea nemoralis and Cepaea hortensis. These data were
               then compared with historical records to detect evolutionary
               change that may have taken place in the decades between samples.
               3. Records of polymorphism in over 7000 populations sampled
               throughout the natural range of the two species were captured
               from published and unpublished sources and added to an online
               database. These data could be explored by the general public via
               a Google Maps interface on the project website
               (http://evolutionmegalab.org). The website contained a welcome
               page that explained what evolution is and how recent changes in
               climate, and the abundance of predatory birds (song thrushes
               Turdus philomelos) might have caused an evolutionary change in
               the shell patterns of banded snails. 4. A network of
               collaborators in 15 European countries was formed, with each
               country responsible for translating the website and associated
               materials, recruiting volunteers and raising any funds required
               locally. A total of 6461 users registered with the site, and
               7629 records were submitted. We used an online quiz to train
               users and to test their ability, to recognize the correct snails
               and their morphs. Every user received automated, immediate
               feedback that compared their data with nearby records from the
               historical database. 5. The critical tasks achieved by the
               Evolution MegaLab that any citizen science project must tackle
               are as follows: (i) design of an appropriate project, (ii)
               recruitment, motivation and training of volunteers, and (iii)

              communities that repeatedly collect ideas for new products and

              about the nature of an individual's ideation efforts in such an
              online community. Studying Dell's IdeaStorm community, serial
              ideators are found to be more likely than consumers with only one
              idea to generate an idea the organization finds valuable enough
              to implement, but they are unlikely to repeat their early success
              once their ideas are implemented. As ideators with past success
              attempt to again come up with ideas that will excite the
              organization, they instead end up proposing ideas similar to
              their ideas that were already implemented (i.e., they generate

              somewhat mitigated for ideators with diverse commenting activity

                 that require human involvement. Tasks like genome annotation,
                 image analysis, knowledge-base population and protein
                 structure determination all benefit from human input. In some
                 cases, people are needed in vast quantities, whereas in
                 others, we need just a few with rare abilities. Crowdsourcing
                 encompasses an emerging collection of approaches for
                 harnessing such distributed human intelligence. Recently, the
                 bioinformatics community has begun to apply crowdsourcing in a
                 variety of contexts, yet few resources are available that
                 describe how these human-powered systems work and how to use

                 provide a framework for understanding and applying several
                 different types of crowdsourcing. The framework considers two
                 broad classes: systems for solving large-volume 'microtasks'
                 and systems for solving high-difficulty 'megatasks'. Within
                 these classes, we discuss system types, including volunteer

                 innovation contests. We illustrate each system type with
                 successful examples in bioinformatics and conclude with a

              open collaborative fashion, in projects sometimes referred to as
              ``crowd science'', ``citizen science'', or ``networked science''.
              This paper seeks to gain a more systematic understanding of crowd
              science and to provide scholars with a conceptual framework and
              an agenda for future research. First, we briefly present three
              case examples that span different fields of science and
              illustrate the heterogeneity concerning what crowd science
              projects do and how they are organized. Second, we identify two
              fundamental elements that characterize crowd science projects --
              open participation and open sharing of intermediate inputs -- and
              distinguish crowd science from other knowledge production regimes
              such as innovation contests or traditional ``Mertonian'' science.
              Third, we explore potential knowledge-related and motivational
              benefits that crowd science offers over alternative
              organizational modes, and potential challenges it is likely to
              face. Drawing on prior research on the organization of problem
              solving, we also consider for what kinds of tasks particular

  abstract = "Abstract Scholars have recently highlighted the promise of open
              innovation. In this paper, we treat open innovation---in it's
              different forms and manifestations---as well as internal or
              closed innovation, as unique governance forms with different
              benefits and costs. We discuss how each governance form, whether
              open or closed, is composed of a set of instruments that access
              (a) different types of communication channels for knowledge
              sharing, (b) different types of incentives, and (c) different
              types of property rights for appropriating value from innovation.
              We focus on the innovation ``problem'' as the central unit of
              analysis, arguing for a match between problem types and
              governance forms, which vary from open to closed and which
              support alternative forms of solution search. In all, the goal of
              this paper is to provide a comparative framework for managing
              innovation, where we delineate and discuss four categories of
              open innovation governance forms (markets, partnerships, contests
              and tournaments and user or community innovation) and compare
              them with each other and with two internal or closed forms of

               data collection and interpretation process together with
               scientists is often referred to as citizen science. While
               citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientific
               practice, developments in sensing technology, data processing
               and visualisation, and communication of ideas and results, are
               creating a wide range of new opportunities for public
               participation in scientific research. This paper reviews the
               state of citizen science in a hydrological context and explores
               the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional
               ways of scientific data collection and knowledge generation for
               hydrological sciences and water resources management. Although
               hydrological data collection often involves advanced technology,
               the advent of robust, cheap and low-maintenance sensing
               equipment provides unprecedented opportunities for data
               collection in a citizen science context. These data have a
               significant potential to create new hydrological knowledge,
               especially in relation to the characterisation of process
               heterogeneity, remote regions, and human impacts on the water
               cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected in
               citizen science experiments is potentially very different from
               those of traditional monitoring networks. This poses challenges
               in terms of their processing, interpretation, and use,
               especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge,
               the quantification of uncertainties, and their role in decision
               support. It also requires care in designing citizen science
               projects such that the generated data complement optimally other
               available knowledge. Lastly, we reflect on the challenges and
               opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented
               citizen science in water resources management, the role of
               scientific knowledge in the decision-making process, and the

              takes place and is grounded in specific sites and socioecological

              places in which they explore, collect, and gather information are

                 Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a
                 paradigm in which an adaptive pacing signal simulates a
                 virtual partner, we examined the neural substrates underlying
                 dynamic joint action. A single parameter controlled the degree
                 to which the virtual partner adapted its behavior in relation
                 to participant taps, thus simulating varying degrees of
                 cooperativity. Analyses of fMRI data using objective and
                 subjective measures of synchronization quality found the
                 relative balance of activity in two distinct neural networks
                 to depend on the degree of the virtual partner's adaptivity.
                 At lower degrees of adaptivity, when the virtual partner was
                 easier to synchronize with, cortical midline structures were
                 activated in conjunction with premotor areas, suggesting a

                 conceptualizes action and perception as separate, peripheral
                 processes. In contrast, embodied accounts of music cognition
                 emphasize the central role of the close coupling of action and
                 perception. It is a commonly established fact that perception
                 spurs action tendencies. We present a theoretical framework
                 that captures the ways in which the human motor system and its
                 actions can reciprocally influence the perception of music.
                 The cornerstone of this framework is the common coding theory,
                 postulating a representational overlap in the brain between
                 the planning, the execution, and the perception of movement.
                 The integration of action and perception in so-called internal
                 models is explained as a result of associative learning
                 processes. Characteristic of internal models is that they
                 allow intended or perceived sensory states to be transferred
                 into corresponding motor commands (inverse modeling), and vice
                 versa, to predict the sensory outcomes of planned actions
                 (forward modeling). Embodied accounts typically refer to
                 inverse modeling to explain action effects on music perception
                 (Leman, 2007). We extend this account by pinpointing forward
                 modeling as an alternative mechanism by which action can
                 modulate perception. We provide an extensive overview of
                 recent empirical evidence in support of this idea.
                 Additionally, we demonstrate that motor dysfunctions can cause
                 perceptual disabilities, supporting the main idea of the paper
                 that the human motor system plays a functional role in
                 auditory perception. The finding that music perception is
                 shaped by the human motor system and its actions suggests that
                 the musical mind is highly embodied. However, we advocate for
                 a more radical approach to embodied (music) cognition in the
                 sense that it needs to be considered as a dynamical process,
                 in which aspects of action, perception, introspection, and
                 social interaction are of crucial importance.",

                 movement in a listener. This study examines the effects of
                 listening to groove music on corticospinal excitability.
                 Musicians and non-musicians listened to high-groove music,
                 low-groove music, and spectrally matched noise, while
                 receiving single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
                 over the primary motor cortex either on-beat or off-beat. We
                 examined changes in the amplitude of the motor-evoked
                 potentials (MEPs), recorded from hand and arm muscles, as an
                 index of activity within the motor system. Musicians and
                 non-musicians rated groove similarly. MEP results showed that
                 high-groove music modulated corticospinal excitability,
                 whereas no difference occurred between low-groove music and
                 noise. More specifically, musicians' MEPs were larger with
                 high-groove than low-groove music, and this effect was
                 especially pronounced for on-beat compared to off-beat pulses.
                 These results indicate that high-groove music increasingly
                 engages the motor system, and the temporal modulation of
                 corticospinal excitability with the beat could stem from tight
                 auditory-motor links in musicians. Conversely, non-musicians'
                 MEPs were smaller for high-groove than low-groove music, and
                 there was no effect of on- versus off-beat pulses, potentially
                 stemming from suppression of overt movement. In sum,
                 high-groove music engages the motor system, and previous
                 training modulates how listening to music with a strong groove
                 activates the motor system.",

  abstract    = "Sixty years ago, Karl Lashley suggested that complex action
                 sequences, from simple motor acts to language and music, are a
                 fundamental but neglected aspect of neural function. Lashley
                 demonstrated the inadequacy of then-standard models of
                 associative chaining, positing a more flexible and generalized
                 ``syntax of action'' necessary to encompass key aspects of
                 language and music. He suggested that hierarchy in language
                 and music builds upon a more basic sequential action system,
                 and provided several concrete hypotheses about the nature of
                 this system. Here, we review a diverse set of modern data
                 concerning musical, linguistic, and other action processing,
                 finding them largely consistent with an updated
                 neuroanatomical version of Lashley's hypotheses. In
                 particular, the lateral premotor cortex, including Broca's
                 area, plays important roles in hierarchical processing in
                 language, music, and at least some action sequences. Although
                 the precise computational function of the lateral prefrontal
                 regions in action syntax remains debated, Lashley's
                 notion-that this cortical region implements a working-memory
                 buffer or stack scannable by posterior and subcortical brain
                 regions-is consistent with considerable experimental data.",

  abstract    = "Sadness is generally seen as a negative emotion, a response to
                 distressing and adverse situations. In an aesthetic context,
                 however, sadness is often associated with some degree of
                 pleasure, as suggested by the ubiquity and popularity,
                 throughout history, of music, plays, films and paintings with
                 a sad content. Here, we focus on the fact that music regarded
                 as sad is often experienced as pleasurable. Compared to other
                 art forms, music has an exceptional ability to evoke a
                 wide-range of feelings and is especially beguiling when it
                 deals with grief and sorrow. Why is it, then, that while human
                 survival depends on preventing painful experiences, mental
                 pain often turns out to be explicitly sought through music? In
                 this article we consider why and how sad music can become
                 pleasurable. We offer a framework to account for how listening
                 to sad music can lead to positive feelings, contending that
                 this effect hinges on correcting an ongoing homeostatic
                 imbalance. Sadness evoked by music is found pleasurable: (1)
                 when it is perceived as non-threatening; (2) when it is
                 aesthetically pleasing; and (3) when it produces psychological
                 benefits such as mood regulation, and empathic feelings,
                 caused, for example, by recollection of and reflection on past
                 events. We also review neuroimaging studies related to music
                 and emotion and focus on those that deal with sadness. Further
                 exploration of the neural mechanisms through which stimuli
                 that usually produce sadness can induce a positive affective
                 state could help the development of effective therapies for
                 disorders such as depression, in which the ability to
                 experience pleasure is attenuated.",

                   paper Predicate Logic as a Programming Language was a
                   breakthrough for the use of logic in computer science. The
                   more recent tremendous progress in automated reasoning
                   technologies, particularly in SAT solving and Constraint
                   Programming, has paved the way for the use of logic as a
                   modelling language. \% This paper describes the realisation
                   of such a modelling language as the IDP KBS. In contrast to
                   declarative programming, the user only specifies her
                   knowledge about a problem and has not to pay attention to
                   control issues. In the IDP system, declarative modelling is
                   done in the language FO(.) which combines inductive
                   definitions (similar to sets of Prolog rules) with
                   first-order logic, types and aggregates, allowing for
                   concise specifications. The paper presents the language,
                   motivates the design choices and gives an overview of the
                   system architecture and the implementation techniques. It
                   also gives an overview of different inference tasks
                   supported by the system such as query evaluation, model
                   expansion and theorem proving, and explains in detail how
                   combining various functionalities results in a
                   state-of-the-art model expansion engine. Finally, it
                   explains how a tight integration with a procedural language
                   (Lua) allows users to treat logical components as
                   first-class citizens and to solve complex problems in a

  abstract    = "It is often claimed that music and language share a process of
                 hierarchical structure building, a mental ``syntax.'' Although
                 several lines of research point to commonalities, and possibly
                 a shared syntactic component, differences between ``language
                 syntax'' and ``music syntax'' can also be found at several
                 levels: conveyed meaning, and the atoms of combination, for
                 example. To bring music and language closer to one another,
                 some researchers have suggested a comparison between music and
                 phonology (``phonological syntax''), but here too, one quickly
                 arrives at a situation of intriguing similarities and obvious
                 differences. In this paper, we suggest that a fruitful
                 comparison between the two domains could benefit from taking
                 the grammar of action into account. In particular, we suggest
                 that what is called ``syntax'' can be investigated in terms of
                 goal of action, action planning, motor control, and
                 sensory-motor integration. At this level of comparison, we
                 suggest that some of the differences between language and
                 music could be explained in terms of different goals reflected
                 in the hierarchical structures of action planning: the
                 hierarchical structures of music arise to achieve goals with a
                 strong relation to the affective-gestural system encoding
                 tension-relaxation patterns as well as socio-intentional
                 system, whereas hierarchical structures in language are
                 embedded in a conceptual system that gives rise to
                 compositional meaning. Similarities between music and language
                 are most clear in the way several hierarchical plans for
                 executing action are processed in time and sequentially
                 integrated to achieve various goals.",

  title    = "Itemset mining: A constraint programming perspective",
  author   = "Guns, Tias and Nijssen, Siegfried and De Raedt, Luc",
  abstract = "The field of data mining has become accustomed to specifying
              constraints on patterns of interest. A large number of systems
              and techniques has been developed for solving such
              constraint-based mining problems, especially for mining itemsets.
              The approach taken in the field of data mining contrasts with the
              constraint programming principles developed within the artificial
              intelligence community. While most data mining research focuses
              on algorithmic issues and aims at developing highly optimized and
              scalable implementations that are tailored towards specific
              tasks, constraint programming employs a more declarative
              approach. The emphasis lies on developing high-level modeling
              languages and general solvers that specify what the problem is,
              rather than outlining how a solution should be computed, yet are
              powerful enough to be used across a wide variety of applications
              and application domains. This paper contributes a declarative
              constraint programming approach to data mining. More
              specifically, we show that it is possible to employ off-the-shelf
              constraint programming techniques for modeling and solving a wide
              variety of constraint-based itemset mining tasks, such as
              frequent, closed, discriminative, and cost-based itemset mining.
              In particular, we develop a basic constraint programming model
              for specifying frequent itemsets and show that this model can
              easily be extended to realize the other settings. This contrasts
              with typical procedural data mining systems where the underlying
              procedures need to be modified in order to accommodate new types
              of constraint, or novel combinations thereof. Even though the
              performance of state-of-the-art data mining systems outperforms
              that of the constraint programming approach on some standard
              tasks, we also show that there exist problems where the
              constraint programming approach leads to significant performance
              improvements over state-of-the-art methods in data mining and as
              well as to new insights into the underlying data mining problems.
              Many such insights can be obtained by relating the underlying
              search algorithms of data mining and constraint programming
              systems to one another. We discuss a number of interesting new
              research questions and challenges raised by the declarative

              flow follows the structure of the grammar and hence they are easy
              to write and to debug. However, the class of grammars which admit
              RD parsers is very limited. Backtracking techniques may be used
              to extend this class, but can have explosive runtimes and cannot
              deal with grammars with left recursion. Tomita-style RNGLR
              parsers are fully general but are based on LR techniques and do
              not have the direct relationship with the grammar that an RD
              parser has. We develop the fully general GLL parsing technique
              which is recursive descent-like, and has the property that the
              parse follows closely the structure of the grammar rules, but
              uses RNGLR-like machinery to handle non-determinism. The

                   undergraduate and early graduate students to automata
                   theory, grammars, constructive proofs, computability, and
                   decidability. Programming students find these topics to be
                   challenging or, in many cases, overwhelming and on the
                   fringe of Computer Science. The existence of this perception
                   is not completely absurd since students are asked to design
                   and prove correct machines and grammars without being able
                   to experiment nor get immediate feedback, which is essential
                   in a learning context. This article puts forth the thesis
                   that the theory of computation ought to be taught using
                   tools for actually building computations. It describes the
                   implementation and the classroom use of a library, FSM,

                   experiment and test their designs using state machines,

                   perform random testing before proceeding with a formal proof
                   of correctness. That is, students can test their designs

                   they develop as part of the constructive proofs they write.
                   Providing students with this ability ought to be a new trend

                 capture biomedical phenomena from texts by extracting
                 relations between biomedical entities (i.e. proteins and
                 genes). Traditionally, only binary relations have been
                 extracted from large numbers of published papers. Recently,
                 more complex relations (biomolecular events) have also been
                 extracted. Such events may include several entities or other
                 relations. To evaluate the performance of the text mining
                 systems, several shared task challenges have been arranged for
                 the BioNLP community. With a common and consistent task
                 setting, the BioNLP'09 shared task evaluated complex
                 biomolecular events such as binding and regulation.Finding
                 these events automatically is important in order to improve
                 biomedical event extraction systems. In the present paper, we
                 propose an automatic event extraction system, which contains a
                 model for complex events, by solving a classification problem
                 with rich features. The main contributions of the present
                 paper are: (1) the proposal of an effective bio-event
                 detection method using machine learning, (2) provision of a
                 high-performance event extraction system, and (3) the
                 execution of a quantitative error analysis. The proposed
                 complex (binding and regulation) event detector outperforms
                 the best system from the BioNLP'09 shared task challenge.",

                   simulated inside the pi-calculus. This simulation, however,
                   holds only modulo strong bisimilarity on processes, i.e.
                   there is a slight mismatch between beta-reduction and how it
                   is simulated in the pi-calculus. The idea is that evaluating
                   a lambda-term in the pi-calculus is like running an
                   environment-based abstract machine, rather than applying
                   ordinary beta-reduction. In this paper we show that such an
                   abstract-machine evaluation corresponds to linear weak head
                   reduction, a strategy arising from the representation of
                   lambda-terms as linear logic proof nets, and that the

  abstract      = "Discovering pattern sets or global patterns is an attractive
                   issue from the pattern mining community in order to provide
                   useful information. By combining local patterns satisfying a
                   joint meaning, this approach produces patterns of higher
                   level and thus more useful for the data analyst than the
                   usual local patterns, while reducing the number of patterns.
                   In parallel, recent works investigating relationships
                   between data mining and constraint programming (CP) show
                   that the CP paradigm is a nice framework to model and mine
                   such patterns in a declarative and generic way. We present a
                   constraint-based language which enables us to define queries
                   addressing patterns sets and global patterns. The usefulness
                   of such a declarative approach is highlighted by several
                   examples coming from the clustering based on associations.
                   This language has been implemented in the CP framework.",

  affiliation = "Braavo Enterprises Los Angeles, CA, USA.",
  abstract    = "This paper reveals the way in which musical pitch works as a
                 peculiar form of cognition that reflects upon the organization
                 of the surrounding world as perceived by majority of music
                 users within a socio-cultural formation. The evidence from
                 music theory, ethnography, archeology, organology,
                 anthropology, psychoacoustics, and evolutionary biology is
                 plotted against experimental evidence. Much of the methodology
                 for this investigation comes from studies conducted within the
                 territory of the former USSR. To date, this methodology has
                 remained solely confined to Russian speaking scholars. A brief
                 overview of pitch-set theory demonstrates the need to
                 distinguish between vertical and horizontal harmony, laying
                 out the framework for virtual music space that operates
                 according to the perceptual laws of tonal gravity. Brought to
                 life by bifurcation of music and speech, tonal gravity passed
                 through eleven discrete stages of development until the onset
                 of tonality in the seventeenth century. Each stage presents
                 its own method of integration of separate musical tones into
                 an auditory-cognitive unity. The theory of ``melodic
                 intonation'' is set forth as a counterpart to harmonic theory
                 of chords. Notions of tonality, modality, key, diatonicity,
                 chromaticism, alteration, and modulation are defined in terms
                 of their perception, and categorized according to the way in
                 which they have developed historically. Tonal organization in
                 music, and perspective organization in fine arts are explained
                 as products of the same underlying mental process. Music seems
                 to act as a unique medium of symbolic representation of
                 reality through the concept of pitch. Tonal organization of
                 pitch reflects the culture of thinking, adopted as a standard
                 within a community of music users. Tonal organization might be
                 a naturally formed system of optimizing individual perception
                 of reality within a social group and its immediate
                 environment, setting conventional standards of intellectual
                 and emotional intelligence.",

  abstract = "Because of the increasing gap between the speeds of processors
              and main memories, compilers must enhance the locality of
              applications to achieve high performance. Loop fusion enhances
              locality by fusing loops that access similar sets of data.
              Typically, it is applied to loops at the same level after loop
              interchange, which first attains the best nesting order for each
              local loop nest. However, since loop interchange cannot foresee
              the overall optimization effect, it often selects the wrong loops
              to be placed outermost for fusion, achieving suboptimal
              performance globally. Building on traditional unimodular
              transformations on perfectly nested loops, we present a novel
              transformation, dependence hoisting, that effectively combines
              interchange and fusion for arbitrarily nested loops. We present
              techniques to simultaneously interchange and fuse loops at
              multiple levels. By evaluating the compound optimization effect
              beforehand, we have achieved better performance than was possible
              by previous techniques, which apply interchange and fusion
              separately.",

              programming, and propose some less familiar laws for concurrent
              programming. On the basis of these laws, we derive the rules of a
              number of classical programming and process calculi, for example,
              those due to Hoare, Milner, and Kahn. The algebraic laws are
              simpler than each of the calculi derived from it, and they are
              stronger than all the calculi put together. Conversely, most of
              the laws are derivable from one or more of the calculi. This
              suggests that the laws are useful as a presentation of program
              semantics, and correspond to a widely held common understanding
              of the meaning of programs. For further evidence, Appendix A
              describes a realistic and generic model of program behaviour,

                   composition, together with the identity relation. We make
                   more powerful languages by adding any of the following

                   coprojection; converse; and the diversity relation. All

  abstract = "Although an extensive literature exists on creativity and music,
              there is a lack of published research investigating possible
              links between musical creativity and Csikszentmihalyi's concept
              of flow or optimal experience. This article examines a group
              composition task to study the relationships between creativity,
              flow and the quality of the compositions produced. First-year
              university students (n = 45) worked on a group composition task
              during three meetings. Each time the students met, they completed
              a detailed questionnaire that assessed aspects of each student's
              experience of the group compositional process using an
              ‘experience sampling form’ based on Csikszentmihalyi's previous
              work. Completed compositions were recorded and rated for quality
              and creativity by the participants and by a group of music
              education specialists (n= 24). Results indicated a number of ways
              in which the specialists’ assessments of quality related to the
              students’ assessments of creativity and flow. The study provides
              an example of a research method that can be used to further our
              understanding of the processes and outcomes of group music
              composition tasks. The discussion also considers a number of
              important ways that the concept of flow can be utilized within a

                   describe a top-down parser for a language. However, error
                   handling techniques that are often applied to top-down
                   parsers are not directly applicable to PEGs. This problem is
                   usually solved in PEG implementations by using an heuristic
                   that helps to simulate the error reporting technique from
                   top-down parsers. We show how implementations that have
                   semantic actions can have grammars that use this heuristic
                   even if the implementation does not implement it direcly. We
                   also add this heuristic to a formal semantics of PEGs. We
                   also propose a complementary error reporting strategy that
                   can lead to better error messages: labeled failures. This
                   approach is inspired by standard exception handling of
                   programming languages, and lets a PEG define different kinds
                   of failure, with each ordered choice operator specifying
                   which kinds it catches. Labeled failures not only give a way
                   to annotate grammars for better error reporting, but also
                   are expressive enough to express some of the error reporting
                   strategies used by deterministic parser combinators, and
                   give a way of encoding predictive top-down parsing in a PEG.",

                   dynamically manipulated data structures. The
                   state-of-the-art methods are limited to the unfold-and-match
                   (U+M) paradigm, where predicates are transformed via
                   (un)folding operations induced from their definitions before
                   being treated as uninterpreted. However, proof obligations
                   from verifying programs with iterative loops and multiple
                   function calls often do not succumb to this paradigm. Our
                   contribution is a proof method which -- beyond U+M --
                   performs automatic formula re-writing by treating previously
                   encountered obligations in each proof path as possible
                   induction hypotheses. This enables us, for the first time,
                   to systematically reason about a wide range of obligations,
                   arising from practical program verification. We demonstrate
                   the power of our proof rules on commonly used lemmas,
                   thereby close the remaining gaps in existing
                   state-of-the-art systems. Another impact, probably more
                   important, is that our method regains the power of
                   compositional reasoning, and shows that the usage of
                   user-provided lemmas is no longer needed for the existing
                   set of benchmarks. This not only removes the burden of
                   coming up with the appropriate lemmas, but also
                   significantly boosts up the verification process, since
                   lemma applications, coupled with unfolding, often induce
                   very large search space.",

  abstract      = "Graph processing is used extensively in areas from social
                   networking mining to web indexing. We demonstrate that the
                   performance and dependability of such applications
                   critically hinges on the graph data structure used, because
                   a fixed, compile-time choice of data structure can lead to
                   poor performance or applications unable to complete. To
                   address this problem, we introduce an approach that helps
                   programmers transform regular, off-the-shelf graph
                   applications into adaptive, more dependable applications
                   where adaptations are performed via runtime selection from
                   alternate data structure representations. Using our
                   approach, applications dynamically adapt to the input
                   graph's characteristics and changes in available memory so
                   they continue to run when faced with adverse conditions such
                   as low memory. Experiments with graph algorithms on
                   real-world (e.g., Wikipedia metadata, Gnutella topology) and
                   synthetic graph datasets show that our adaptive applications

              makers conceptualize uncertainty? How do decision makers cope
              with uncertainty? Are there systematic relationships between
              different conceptualizations of uncertainty and different methods
              of coping? To answer these questions we analyzed 102 self-reports
              of decision-making under uncertainty with an inclusive method of
              classifying conceptualizations of uncertainty and coping
              mechanisms developed from the decision-making literature. The
              results showed that decision makers distinguished among three
              types of uncertainty: inadequate understanding, incomplete
              information, and undifferentiated alternatives. To these they
              applied five strategies of coping: reducing uncertainty,
              assumption-based reasoning, weighing pros and cons of competing
              alternatives, suppressing uncertainty, and forestalling.
              Inadequate understanding was primarily managed by reduction,
              incomplete information was primarily managed by assumption-based
              reasoning, and conflict among alternatives was primarily managed
              by weighing pros and cons. Based on these results and findings
              from previous studies of naturalistic decision-making we

  abstract = "Abstract Flow is a concept used to describe the pleasurable
              immersion that individuals experience, often in recreational
              activities such as video games. A key component in many video
              games is the player's avatar; through which the player
              experiences the game world and game play. Past theory suggests
              that flow and the identification of a player with their avatar
              are vital aspects of video games and it is this that
              differentiates them from other forms of media. However, research
              on the relationship between flow and avatar/character
              identification is in its infancy. This study aimed to further
              examine these two concepts and their relationship within video
              games. This study consisted of 306 participants, who completed a
              series of self-report questionnaires online. As hypothesised, it
              was found that character identification was strongly and
              positively related to flow. It was also found that only the video
              game specific characteristics of similarity to character and
              customisation were negatively and positively related to flow
              respectively. Furthermore, similarity but not customisation was
              related to character identification, and that similarity was
              strongly and positively related to character identification.
              Other findings include Openness to Experience being positively
              related to character identification, and Extraversion being
              negatively related to character identification.",

                   variety of problems. The sheer amount of data to be
                   processed has prompted the creation of a myriad of systems
                   that help us cope with massive scale graphs. The pressure to
                   deliver fast responses to queries on the graph is higher
                   than ever before, as it is demanded by many applications
                   (e.g. online recommendations, auctions, terrorism
                   protection, etc.). In addition, graphs change continuously
                   (so do the real world entities that typically represent).
                   Systems must be ready for both: near real-time and dynamic
                   massive graphs. We survey systems taking their scalability,
                   real-time potential and capability to support dynamic
                   changes to the graph as driving guidelines. The main

                   prime time dynamism either. Therefore,a short overview on

                   for inherently dynamic data storage environments. Such
                   environments are characterized by two challenging features:
                   (a) they have little idle system time to devote on physical
                   design; and (b) there is little, if any, a priori workload
                   knowledge, while the query and data workload keeps changing
                   dynamically. In such environments, traditional approaches to
                   index building and maintenance cannot apply. Database
                   cracking has been proposed as a solution that allows
                   on-the-fly physical data reorganization, as a collateral
                   effect of query processing. Cracking aims to continuously
                   and automatically adapt indexes to the workload at hand,
                   without human intervention. Indexes are built incrementally,
                   adaptively, and on demand. Nevertheless, as we show,
                   existing adaptive indexing methods fail to deliver
                   workload-robustness; they perform much better with random
                   workloads than with others. This frailty derives from the
                   inelasticity with which these approaches interpret each
                   query as a hint on how data should be stored. Current
                   cracking schemes blindly reorganize the data within each
                   query's range, even if that results into successive
                   expensive operations with minimal indexing benefit. In this
                   paper, we introduce stochastic cracking, a significantly
                   more resilient approach to adaptive indexing. Stochastic
                   cracking also uses each query as a hint on how to reorganize
                   data, but not blindly so; it gains resilience and avoids
                   performance bottlenecks by deliberately applying certain
                   arbitrary choices in its decision-making. Thereby, we bring
                   adaptive indexing forward to a mature formulation that
                   confers the workload-robustness previous approaches lacked.
                   Our extensive experimental study verifies that stochastic
                   cracking maintains the desired properties of original
                   database cracking while at the same time it performs well
                   with diverse realistic workloads.",

                   graphs serve two main purposes. Firstly, they provide a

                   recording the interactions between people, software systems,
                   and the physical world is becoming increasingly prevalent.
                   This data often takes the form of a temporally evolving
                   graph, where entities are the vertices and the interactions
                   between them are the edges. We call such graphs interaction
                   graphs. Various application domains, including
                   telecommunications, transportation, and social media, depend
                   on analytics performed on interaction graphs. The ability to
                   efficiently support historical analysis over interaction
                   graphs require effective solutions for the problem of data
                   layout on disk. This paper presents an adaptive disk layout
                   called the railway layout for optimizing disk block storage
                   for interaction graphs. The key idea is to divide blocks
                   into one or more sub-blocks, where each sub-block contains a
                   subset of the attributes, but the entire graph structure is
                   replicated within each sub-block. This improves query I/O,
                   at the cost of increased storage overhead. We introduce
                   optimal ILP formulations for partitioning disk blocks into
                   sub-blocks with overlapping and non-overlapping attributes.
                   Additionally, we present greedy heuristic approaches that
                   can scale better compared to the ILP alternatives, yet
                   achieve close to optimal query I/O. To demonstrate the
                   benefits of the railway layout, we provide an extensive
                   experimental study comparing our approach to a few baseline
                   alternatives.",

                   error-control coding and matrix computations, whose
                   underlying data flow graphs are based on finite
                   projective-geometry(PG) based balanced bipartite graphs.
                   Many of these applications are actively being researched
                   upon. Almost all these applications need bipartite graphs of
                   the order of tens of thousands in practice, whose nodes
                   represent parallel computations. To reduce its
                   implementation cost, reducing amount of system/hardware
                   resources during design is an important engineering
                   objective. In this context, we present a scheme to reduce
                   resource utilization when performing computations derived
                   from PG-based graphs. In a fully parallel design based on PG
                   concepts, the number of processing units is equal to the
                   number of vertices, each performing an atomic computation.
                   To reduce the number of processing units used for
                   implementation, we present an easy way of partitioning the
                   vertex set. Each block of partition is then assigned to a
                   processing unit. A processing unit performs the computations
                   corresponding to the vertices in the block assigned to it in
                   a sequential fashion, thus creating the effect of folding
                   the overall computation. These blocks have certain symmetric
                   properties that enable us to develop a conflict-free
                   schedule. The scheme achieves the best possible throughput,
                   in lack of any overhead of shuffling data across memories
                   while scheduling another computation on the same processing
                   unit. This paper reports two folding schemes, which are
                   based on same lattice embedding approach, based on
                   partitioning. We first provide a scheme for a projective
                   space of dimension five, and the corresponding schedules.
                   Both the folding schemes that we present have been verified
                   by both simulation and hardware prototyping for different
                   applications. We later generalize this scheme to arbitrary
                   projective spaces.",

  abstract = "Abstract Provenance has become increasingly important in
              scientific workflows to understand, verify, and reproduce the
              result of scientific data analysis. Most existing systems store
              provenance data in provenance stores with proprietary provenance
              data models and conduct query processing over the physical
              provenance storages using query languages, such as SQL, SPARQL,
              and XQuery, which are closely coupled to the underlying storage
              strategies. Querying provenance at such low level leads to poor
              usability of the system: a user needs to know the underlying
              schema to formulate queries; if the schema changes, queries need
              to be reformulated; and queries formulated for one system will
              not run in another system. In this paper, we present OPQL, a
              provenance query language that enables the querying of provenance
              directly at the graph level. An OPQL query takes a provenance
              graph as input and produces another provenance graph as output.
              Therefore, OPQL queries are not tightly coupled to the underlying
              provenance storage strategies. Our main contributions are: (i) we
              design OPQL, including six types of graph patterns, a provenance
              graph algebra, and OPQL syntax and semantics, that supports
              querying provenance at the graph level; (ii) we implement OPQL
              using a Web service via our OPMProv system; therefore, users can
              invoke the Web service to execute OPQL queries in a provenance
              browser, called OPMProVis. The result of OPQL queries is
              displayed as a provenance graph in OPMProVis. An experimental
              study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of
              OPMProv on OPQL provenance querying.",

                   stock trading) are write-heavy in nature. The shift from
                   reads to writes in web applications has also been
                   accelerating in recent years. Write-ahead-logging is a
                   common approach for providing recovery capability while
                   improving performance in most storage systems. However, the
                   separation of log and application data incurs write
                   overheads observed in write-heavy environments and hence
                   adversely affects the write throughput and recovery time in
                   the system. In this paper, we introduce LogBase - a scalable
                   log-structured database system that adopts log-only storage
                   for removing the write bottleneck and supporting fast system
                   recovery. LogBase is designed to be dynamically deployed on
                   commodity clusters to take advantage of elastic scaling
                   property of cloud environments. LogBase provides in-memory
                   multiversion indexes for supporting efficient access to data
                   maintained in the log. LogBase also supports transactions
                   that bundle read and write operations spanning across
                   multiple records. We implemented the proposed system and
                   compared it with HBase and a disk-based log-structured

                   that allows for scalable execution on distributed systems
                   naturally. However, there are limitations to this approach

              text-to-text generation technique for synthesizing common
              information across documents. Sentence fusion involves bottom-up
              local multisequence alignment to identify phrases conveying
              similar information and statistical generation to combine common
              phrases into a sentence. Sentence fusion moves the summarization

              of abstracts that contain sentences not found in any of the input

  abstract    = "Is there something special about the way music communicates
                 feelings? Theorists since Meyer (1956) have attempted to
                 explain how music could stimulate varied and subtle affective
                 experiences by violating learned expectancies, or by mimicking
                 other forms of social interaction. Our proposal is that music
                 speaks to the brain in its own language; it need not imitate
                 any other form of communication. We review recent theoretical
                 and empirical literature, which suggests that all conscious
                 processes consist of dynamic neural events, produced by
                 spatially dispersed processes in the physical brain.
                 Intentional thought and affective experience arise as
                 dynamical aspects of neural events taking place in multiple
                 brain areas simultaneously. At any given moment, this content
                 comprises a unified ``scene'' that is integrated into a
                 dynamic core through synchrony of neuronal oscillations. We
                 propose that (1) neurodynamic synchrony with musical stimuli
                 gives rise to musical qualia including tonal and temporal
                 expectancies, and that (2) music-synchronous responses couple
                 into core neurodynamics, enabling music to directly modulate
                 core affect. Expressive music performance, for example, may
                 recruit rhythm-synchronous neural responses to support
                 affective communication. We suggest that the dynamic
                 relationship between musical expression and the experience of
                 affect presents a unique opportunity for the study of
                 emotional experience. This may help elucidate the neural
                 mechanisms underlying arousal and valence, and offer a new
                 approach to exploring the complex dynamics of the how and why
                 of emotional experience.",

              applications on the Internet. Websites are the important
              interfaces in HCI (Human--Computer Interaction). Website design
              significantly affects online shopping behavior. This research
              used eye-tracker to track the eye-movement process for 42 college
              students when they were surfing websites with different levels of
              complexity and completing simple and complex tasks respectively.
              The study examines how website complexity and task complexity
              jointly affect users' visual attention and behavior due to
              different cognitive loads. The study fills a research gap by
              examining this phenomenon from the cognitive load perspective and
              taking the moderate effect of task complexity into consideration.
              The results show that task complexity can moderate the effect of
              website complexity on users' visual attention and behavior.
              Specifically, when users conducted a simple task, fixation count
              and task completion time were at the highest level on the website
              with high complexity, while fixation duration was not
              significantly different on the websites with different
              complexity. However, when users conducted a complex task on a
              website with medium complexity, task completion time, fixation
              count, and fixation duration were all at their highest level. The
              load theory of attention was used to provide the explanation for
              the results. The findings provide guidelines for website managers

                 speeds of abstract and specific knowledge within a Bayesian
                 framework and the role for innate structure. We focus on
                 knowledge about causality, seen as a domain-general intuitive
                 theory, and ask whether this knowledge can be learned from
                 co-occurrence of events. We begin by phrasing the causal Bayes
                 nets theory of causality and a range of alternatives in a
                 logical language for relational theories. This allows us to
                 explore simultaneous inductive learning of an abstract theory
                 of causality and a causal model for each of several causal
                 systems. We find that the correct theory of causality can be
                 learned relatively quickly, often becoming available before
                 specific causal theories have been learned--an effect we term
                 the blessing of abstraction. We then explore the effect of
                 providing a variety of auxiliary evidence and find that a
                 collection of simple perceptual input analyzers can help to
                 bootstrap abstract knowledge. Together, these results suggest
                 that the most efficient route to causal knowledge may be to
                 build in not an abstract notion of causality but a powerful
                 inductive learning mechanism and a variety of perceptual
                 supports. While these results are purely computational, they

                   rather than as a shorthand for Pr(ab)/Pr(b). The next issue
                   is to define boolean combinations of conditional objects,
                   and possibly also the operator of further conditioning.
                   These questions have been investigated at least since the
                   times of George Boole, leading to a number of formalisms
                   proposed for conditional objects, mostly of syntactical,
                   proof-theoretic vein. We propose a unifying, semantical
                   approach, in which conditional events are (projections of)
                   Markov chains, definable in the three-valued extension of
                   the past tense fragment of propositional linear time logic,

              many well-known examples of security weaknesses exploited in

              development is urgently needed. In particular, an important
              missing link in the construction of secure systems is finding a
              practical way to create reliably secure crypto protocol
              implementations. We present an approach that aims to address this
              need by making use of a domain-specific language for crypto
              protocol implementations. One can use this language to construct
              a compact and precise yet executable representation of a
              cryptographic protocol. This high-level program can be verified
              against the security goals using automated theorem provers for
              first order logic. One can then use it to provide assurance for

              representations. Temporal logics with a similar ‘in-time’
              perspective, and in particular those using operators S and U for
              ‘since’ and ‘until’, are explored as a means of representing
              musical situations, with particular reference to a paradigm
              ‘triangle-player problem’. Illustrative implementations are given
              in the music software Pd. New versions of the operators S and U
              are defined to accommodate the musically important phenomena of

                 data. However, these data have not yet been fully explored to
                 improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery,
                 which continues along a one-drug-one-target-one-disease

  abstract    = "The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of
                 evolution typically assumes that the set of possible
                 phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular
                 space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a
                 Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a
                 biophysical genotype-phenotype model based on the folding of
                 RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather
                 different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to
                 genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and
                 is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a
                 pre-topology. Patterns of phenotypic evolution-such as
                 punctuation, irreversibility, modularity--result naturally
                 from the properties of this space. The classical framework,
                 however, addresses these patterns by exclusively invoking
                 natural selection on suitably imposed fitness landscapes. We
                 propose to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic
                 evolution from fitness considerations alone to include the
                 topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the
                 genotype-phenotype map. We introduce the mathematical concepts
                 and tools necessary to formalize the notion of accessibility
                 pre-topology relative to which we can speak of continuity in
                 the genotype-phenotype map and in evolutionary trajectories.
                 We connect the factorization of a pre-topology into a product
                 space with the notion of phenotypic character and derive a
                 condition for factorization. Based on anecdotal evidence from
                 the RNA model, we conjecture that this condition is not
                 globally fulfilled, but rather confined to regions where the
                 genotype-phenotype map is continuous. Equivalently, local
                 regions of genotype space on which the map is discontinuous
                 are associated with the loss of character autonomy. This is
                 consistent with the importance of these regions for phenotypic
                 innovation. The intention of the present paper is to offer a
                 perspective, a framework to implement this perspective, and a
                 few results illustrating how this framework can be put to
                 work. The RNA case is used as an example throughout the text.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Proteins, individual cells, and cell populations
                 denote different levels of an organizational hierarchy, each
                 of which with its own dynamics. Multi-level modeling is
                 concerned with describing a system at these different levels
                 and relating their dynamics. Rule-based modeling has
                 increasingly attracted attention due to enabling a concise and
                 compact description of biochemical systems. In addition, it
                 allows different methods for model analysis, since more than
                 one semantics can be defined for the same syntax. RESULTS:
                 Multi-level modeling implies the hierarchical nesting of model
                 entities and explicit support for downward and upward
                 causation between different levels. Concepts to support
                 multi-level modeling in a rule-based language are identified.
                 To those belong rule schemata, hierarchical nesting of
                 species, assigning attributes and solutions to species at each
                 level and preserving content of nested species while applying
                 rules. Further necessities are the ability to apply rules and
                 flexibly define reaction rate kinetics and constraints on
                 nested species as well as species that are nested within
                 others. An example model is presented that analyses the
                 interplay of an intracellular control circuit with states at
                 cell level, its relation to cell division, and connections to
                 intercellular communication within a population of cells. The
                 example is described in ML-Rules - a rule-based multi-level
                 approach that has been realized within the plug-in-based
                 modeling and simulation framework JAMES II. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Rule-based languages are a suitable starting point for
                 developing a concise and compact language for multi-level
                 modeling of cell biological systems. The combination of
                 nesting species, assigning attributes, and constraining
                 reactions according to these attributes is crucial in
                 achieving the desired expressiveness. Rule schemata allow a
                 concise and compact description of complex models. As a
                 result, the presented approach facilitates developing and
                 maintaining multi-level models that, for instance, interrelate

                 notable in that it allows one to systematically incorporate

                 a model for the dynamics of a signal-transduction system, but

                   about such dependencies is required. Results: We present an
                   approach for endowing protein networks with interaction
                   dependencies using propositional logic, thereby obtaining
                   protein hypernetworks. First we demonstrate how this
                   framework straightforwardly improves the prediction of
                   protein complexes. Next we show that modeling protein
                   perturbations in hypernetworks, rather than in networks,
                   allows to better infer the functional necessity of proteins
                   for yeast. Furthermore, hypernetworks improve the prediction
                   of synthetic lethal interactions in yeast, indicating their
                   capability to capture high-order functional relations
                   between proteins. Conclusion: Protein hypernetworks are a
                   consistent formal framework for modeling dependencies
                   between protein interactions within protein networks. First
                   applications of protein hypernetworks on the yeast
                   interactome indicate their value for inferring functional
                   features of complex biochemical systems.",

                 computational models can support researchers in understanding
                 the dynamic behaviour of biological pathways and support
                 hypothesis formulation and selection by ``in silico''
                 experimentation. An obstacle to widespread adoption of this
                 approach is the requirement to formulate a biological pathway
                 as machine executable computer code. We have recently proposed
                 a novel, biologically intuitive, narrative-style modelling
                 language for biologists to formulate the pathway which is then
                 automatically translated into an executable format and is,
                 thus, usable for analysis via existing simulation techniques.
                 RESULTS: Here we use a high-level narrative language in
                 designing a computational model of the gp130/JAK/STAT
                 signalling pathway and show that the model reproduces the
                 dynamic behaviour of the pathway derived by biological
                 observation. We then ``experiment'' on the model by simulation
                 and sensitivity analysis to define those parameters which
                 dominate the dynamic behaviour of the pathway. The model
                 predicts that nuclear compartmentalisation and phosphorylation
                 status of STAT are key determinants of the pathway and that
                 alternative mechanisms of signal attenuation exert their
                 influence on different timescales. CONCLUSION: The described
                 narrative model of the gp130/JAK/STAT pathway represents an
                 interesting case study showing how, by using this approach,
                 researchers can model biological systems without explicitly
                 dealing with formal notations and mathematical expressions
                 (typically used for biochemical modelling), nevertheless being
                 able to obtain simulation and analysis results. We present the
                 model and the sensitivity analysis results we have obtained,
                 that allow us to identify the parameters which are most
                 sensitive to perturbations. The results, which are shown to be
                 in agreement with existing mathematical models of the
                 gp130/JAK/STAT pathway, serve us as a form of validation of
                 the model and of the approach itself.",

                 Rule-based models provide a powerful alternative to approaches
                 that require explicit enumeration of all possible molecular
                 species of a system. Such models consist of formal rules
                 stipulating the (partial) contexts wherein specific
                 protein-protein interactions occur. These contexts specify
                 molecular patterns that are usually less detailed than
                 molecular species. Yet, the execution of rule-based dynamics
                 requires stochastic simulation, which can be very costly. It
                 thus appears desirable to convert a rule-based model into a
                 reduced system of differential equations by exploiting the
                 granularity at which rules specify interactions. We present a
                 formal (and automated) method for constructing a
                 coarse-grained and self-consistent dynamical system aimed at
                 molecular patterns that are distinguishable by the dynamics of
                 the original system as posited by the rules. The method is
                 formally sound and never requires the execution of the
                 rule-based model. The coarse-grained variables do not depend
                 on the values of the rate constants appearing in the rules,
                 and typically form a system of greatly reduced dimension that
                 can be amenable to numerical integration and further model

                 widely understood and (re)used, conventions for model

                 concepts of an extended contact map and a model guide for
                 illustrating and annotating rule-based models. An extended
                 contact map represents the scope of a model by providing an
                 illustration of each molecule, molecular component, direct
                 physical interaction, post-translational modification, and
                 enzyme-substrate relationship considered in a model. A map can

                 among molecular components, and compartmental locations of
                 molecules. A model guide associates elements of a contact map
                 with annotation and elements of an underlying model, which may
                 be fully or partially specified. A guide can also serve to
                 document the biological knowledge upon which a model is based.
                 We provide examples of a map and guide for a published

                 cell signaling systems but not considered in the example
                 model, such as ubiquitination. An extended contact map and an
                 associated guide can document knowledge of a cell signaling

                 biological phenomena. We call the approach of constructing
                 computational models of biological systems 'executable
                 biology', as it focuses on the design of executable computer
                 algorithms that mimic biological phenomena. We survey the main

                 applicability and benefits of executable models in biological
                 research and highlight some of the challenges that executable
                 biology poses for biology and computer science. We claim that
                 for executable biology to reach its full potential as a
                 mainstream biological technique, formal and algorithmic
                 approaches must be integrated into biological research. This

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Published descriptions of biology protocols are
                 often ambiguous and incomplete, making them difficult to
                 replicate in other laboratories. However, there is increasing
                 benefit to formalizing the descriptions of protocols, as
                 laboratory automation systems (such as microfluidic chips) are
                 becoming increasingly capable of executing them. Our goal in
                 this paper is to improve both the reproducibility and
                 automation of biology experiments by using a programming
                 language to express the precise series of steps taken.
                 RESULTS: We have developed BioCoder, a C++ library that
                 enables biologists to express the exact steps needed to
                 execute a protocol. In addition to being suitable for
                 automation, BioCoder converts the code into a readable,
                 English-language description for use by biologists. We have
                 implemented over 65 protocols in BioCoder; the most complex of
                 these was successfully executed by a biologist in the
                 laboratory using BioCoder as the only reference. We argue that
                 BioCoder exposes and resolves ambiguities in existing
                 protocols, and could provide the software foundations for
                 future automation platforms. BioCoder is freely available for
                 download at
                 http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/india/projects/biocoder/.
                 CONCLUSIONS: BioCoder represents the first practical
                 programming system for standardizing and automating biology
                 protocols. Our vision is to change the way that experimental
                 methods are communicated: rather than publishing a written
                 account of the protocols used, researchers will simply publish
                 the code. Our experience suggests that this practice is
                 tractable and offers many benefits. We invite other
                 researchers to leverage BioCoder to improve the precision and
                 completeness of their protocols, and also to adapt and extend
                 BioCoder to new domains.",

                 formalization of biological properties in temporal logic.
                 BIOCHAM provides tools and languages for describing protein
                 networks with a simple and straightforward syntax, and for
                 integrating biological properties into the model. It then
                 becomes possible to analyze, query, verify and maintain the

  abstract = "Abstract interpretation is a theory of abstraction that has been
              introduced for the analysis of programs. In particular, it has
              proved useful for organizing the multiple semantics of a given
              programming language in a hierarchy corresponding to different
              detail levels, and for defining type systems for programming
              languages and program analyzers in software engineering. In this
              paper, we investigate the application of these concepts to
              systems biology formalisms. More specifically, we consider the
              Systems Biology Markup Language SBML, and the Biochemical
              Abstract Machine BIOCHAM with its differential, stochastic,
              discrete and boolean semantics. We first show how all of these
              different semantics, except the differential one, can be formally
              related by simple Galois connections. Then we define three type
              systems: one for checking or inferring the functions of proteins
              in a reaction model, one for checking or inferring the activation
              and inhibition effects of proteins in a reaction model, and
              another one for checking or inferring the topology of
              compartments or locations. We show that the framework of abstract
              interpretation elegantly applies to the formalization of these
              further abstractions, and to the implementation of linear or
              quadratic time type checking as well as type inference
              algorithms. Furthermore, we show a theorem of independence of the
              graph of activation and inhibition effects from the kinetic
              expressions in the reaction model, under general conditions.
              Through some examples, we show that the analysis of biochemical
              models by type inference provides accurate and useful
              information. Interestingly, such a mathematical formalization of
              the abstractions commonly used in systems biology already

                   novel aspect of BioScapeL is that entities have programmable
                   locations. The programmer can specify a particular location
                   where to place an entity, or a location relative to the
                   current location of the entity. The motivation for the
                   extension comes from the need to describe the evolution of
                   populations of biochemical species in space, while keeping a
                   sufficiently high level description, so that phenomena like
                   diffusion, collision, and confinement can remain part of the
                   semantics of the calculus. Combined with the random
                   diffusion movement inherited from BioScape, programmable
                   locations allow us to capture the assemblies of
                   configurations of polymers, oligomers, and complexes such as
                   microtubules or actin filaments. Further new aspects of

                   translation is instrumental in describing the location of
                   new entities relative to the old ones. For example, when a
                   cell secretes a hydronium ion, the ion should be placed at a
                   given distance from the originating cell, but in a random
                   direction. Additionally, scaling allows us to capture at a
                   high level events such as division and growth; for example,
                   daughter cells after mitosis have half the size of the
                   mother cell.",

  abstract    = "For over a century, psychologists have investigated the mental
                 processes of expert performers - people who display
                 exceptional knowledge and/or skills in specific fields of
                 human achievement. Since the 1960s, expertise researchers have
                 made considerable progress in understanding the cognitive and
                 neural mechanisms that underlie such exceptional performance.
                 Whereas the first modern studies of expertise were conducted
                 in relatively formal knowledge domains such as chess, more
                 recent investigations have explored elite performance in
                 dynamic perceptual-motor activities such as sport.
                 Unfortunately, although these studies have led to the
                 identification of certain domain-free generalizations about
                 expert-novice differences, they shed little light on an
                 important issue: namely, experts' metacognitive activities or
                 their insights into, and regulation of, their own mental
                 processes. In an effort to rectify this oversight, the present
                 paper argues that metacognitive processes and inferences play
                 an important if neglected role in expertise. In particular, we
                 suggest that metacognition (including such processes as
                 ``meta-attention,'' ``meta-imagery'' and ``meta-memory,'' as
                 well as social aspects of this construct) provides a window on
                 the genesis of expert performance. Following a critique of the
                 standard empirical approach to expertise, we explore some
                 research on ``metacognition'' and ``metacognitive inference''
                 among experts in sport. After that, we provide a brief
                 evaluation of the relationship between psychological skills
                 training and metacognition and comment on the measurement of
                 metacognitive processes. Finally, we summarize our conclusions
                 and outline some potentially new directions for research on
                 metacognition in action.",

                 appropriately to novel situations. What kinds of information

  abstract = "Cloud computing is one of the hottest terms in IT today. Yet if
              one asks what it means, a dozen answers will emerge, many of them

              and service offerings in light of the newest fad. But that is not
              satisfactory cloud computing is not just whatever a product
              manager says it is on a given day. There must be some level
              playing field, some criteria from a neutral third party defined
              in some way other than simply that which makes certain vendors
              happy. The 451 Groups Cloud Codex emerged from a long series of
              discussions, arguments and impassioned pleas. No effort was made
              to triangulate or to please the largest number of people
              possible; such efforts rarely lead to true insight. Instead, we
              began with a blank whiteboard and a vision of IT that seems to be
              hovering just over the horizon ready to be actualized but
              tantalizingly out of reach right now. The path to achieving that
              vision in a reasonable time frame must begin with answering a set
              of basic questions, and thats what the Cloud Codex is all about.
              These questions include: What are cloud services? What are the
              criteria hard and fast for defining a cloud? What are the
              different deployment models for an enterprise cloud? Which cloud
              services will providers offer? What features must be developed in
              order for cloud computing to reach a level of general deployment?",

              lower levels of ACAP, even turning negative and becoming harmful

              enhancing financial gains at lower levels of ACAP and mitigating
              the decline in financial performance at higher levels of ACAP.

              reduce the design complexity at both conceptual, technical and
              practical levels. The approach focuses on a relevant subset of
              serious games, labelled scenario-based games. At the conceptual

  author   = "West, Joel and Bogers, Marcel",
  abstract = "This paper reviews research on open innovation that considers how
              and why firms commercialize external sources of innovations. It
              examines both the ``outside-in'' and ``coupled'' modes of open
              innovation. From an analysis of prior research on how firms
              leverage external sources of innovation, it suggests a four-phase
              model in which a linear process - (1) obtaining, (2) integrating,
              and (3) commercializing external innovations - is combined with
              (4) interaction between the firm and its collaborators. This
              model is used to classify papers taken from the top 25 innovation
              journals, complemented by highly cited work beyond those
              journals. A review of 291 open innovation-related publications
              from these sources shows that the majority of these articles
              indeed address elements of this inbound open innovation process
              model. Specifically, it finds that researchers have front-loaded
              their examination of the leveraging process, with an emphasis on
              obtaining innovations from external sources. However, there is a
              relative dearth of research related to integrating and
              commercializing these innovations. Research on obtaining
              innovations includes searching, enabling, filtering, and
              acquiring - each category with its own specific set of mechanisms
              and conditions. Integrating innovations has been mostly studied
              from an absorptive capacity perspective, with less attention
              given to the impact of competencies and culture (including ``not
              invented here''). Commercializing innovations puts the most
              emphasis on how external innovations create value rather than how
              firms capture value from those innovations. Finally, the
              interaction phase considers both feedback for the linear process
              and reciprocal innovation processes such as cocreation, network
              collaboration, and community innovation. This review and
              synthesis suggests several gaps in prior research. One is a
              tendency to ignore the importance of business models, despite
              their central role in distinguishing open innovation from earlier
              research on interorganizational collaboration in innovation.
              Another gap is a tendency in open innovation to use
              ``innovation'' in a way inconsistent with earlier definitions in
              innovation management. The paper concludes with recommendations
              for future research that include examining the end-to-end
              innovation commercialization process, and studying the moderators
              and limits of leveraging external sources of innovation.

  author   = "Wen, Xiao-Gang",
  abstract = "In primary school, we were told that there are four states of
              matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned
              that there are much more than four states of matter. For example,
              there are ferromagnetic states as revealed by the phenomenon of
              magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the phenomenon
              of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are
              so rich that it is amazing that they can be understood
              systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this
              paper, we will review the progress in last 20 -- 30 years, during
              which we discovered that there are even more interesting phases
              that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new
              ``topological'' phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that
              reveal the existence of those new phases - topologically ordered
              phases. Just like zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order,
              the new ``topological'' phenomena define the topological order at
              macroscopic level. As a new type of order, topological order
              requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion category
              and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find
              that, at microscopical level, topological order is due to
              long-range quantum entanglements, just like fermion superfluid is
              due to fermion-pair condensation. Long-range quantum
              entanglements lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as
              fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian statistics,
              and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range quantum
              entanglements can even provide a unified origin of light and
              electrons (or more generally, gauge interactions and Fermi
              statistics): light waves (gauge fields) are fluctuations of
              long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are defects of
              long-range entanglements.",

              modify Kohonen’s SOM in parallel computing environment. In this
              model, two separate layers of neurons are connected together. The
              number of neurons in both layers and connections between them is
              the product of the number of all elements of input signals and
              the number of possible classification of the data. With this
              structure the conventional repeated learning procedure is
              modified to learn just once. The once learning manner is more
              similar to human learning and memorizing activities. During
              training, weight updating is managed through a sequence of
              operations among some transformation and operation matrices.
              Every connection between neurons of input/output layers is
              considered as a independent processor. In this way, all elements
              of the Euclidean distance matrix and weight matrix are calculated
              simultaneously. The minimum distance of every line of distance
              matrix can be found by Grover’s search algorithm. This

              conceived from countermeasures targeted at addressing failure
              factors suggested in the literature. In order to counteract
              failure factors, the approach combines the technology of
              knowledge-based KM systems, with the flexibility and
              understanding of knowledge facilitators, and the processes of the
              target community. In the KM system, the approach uses knowledge
              engineering concepts to represent knowledge artifacts and to
              enforce managerial responsibilities. By imposing a strict
              representation format, the approach guides and helps users. It
              does so by determining what knowledge to contribute, by enabling
              knowledge collection, and by representing knowledge. The purpose
              of knowledge facilitators is to complement the limitations of the
              computer based component by verifying the quality of submitted
              artifacts and by motivating members to adopt the system. The
              design and operation of this approach is guided by identifying
              the processes of the target community and the level of
              specificity where they are useful. The importance of this
              contribution is that it offers guidelines to design a KM approach
              that relies on conclusions from published literature. In
              addition, it also proposes a means to validate knowledge sharing.
              A conclusion of this work is that it may be easier to address
              failure factors of KM approaches when all members of the target
              community have the same technical goals, are motivated by a
              common interest, are organized on a flat hierarchy, and are
              receptive to innovation. In addition, the use of a representation
              of the community's processes helps standardize capture, guide
              contributors, and associate existing with new artifacts. This
              association of artifacts can be used to validate knowledge
              sharing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights

  abstract = "Agile development has become mainstream regarding software
              development processes. Along the increasing understanding of the
              importance of good User eXperience came the need to integrate
              these two areas. However, Agile development have a distinct
              culture that at first glance seems to conflict with User-Centered
              Design. Therefore, integrating these two areas becomes a
              challenging task. This thesis focuses on integrating these areas,
              providing a set of practices and artifacts to support Agile teams
              and Interaction Designers to overcome this challenge. A
              Systematic Literature Review was conducted in order to identify
              existing approaches regarding the integration of Agile and
              Interaction Design. A framework was proposed gathering the most
              common practices and artifacts identified in this review.
              Conducting Action Research in two companies from two different
              countries tried out this proposal. Thus, the result of this
              research is a framework proposal for integrating Interaction
              Design and Agile Development.",

  abstract = "Almost all animal social groups show some form of fission--fusion
              dynamics, whereby group membership is not spatio-temporally

              population and individual levels, exerting an important influence
              on pat- terns of social behaviour, information transfer and
              epidemiology. However, fission--fusion dynamics in birds have
              received relatively little attention. We review the existing evi-
              dence for fission--fusion sociality in birds alongside a more
              general explanation of the social and ecological processes that
              may drive fission--fusion dynamics. Through a combi- nation of
              recent methodological developments and novel technologies with
              well- established areas of ornithological research, avian systems
              offer great potential to further our understanding of
              fission--fusion social systems and the consequences they have at
              an individual and population level. In particular, investigating
              the interaction between social structure and environmental
              covariates can promote a deeper understanding of the evo- lution
              of social behaviour and the adaptive value of group living, as
              well as having important consequences for applied research.

  title    = "Argumentation-based design rationale: what use at what cost",
  author   = "Shum, S B and Hammond, Nick",
  abstract = "A design rationale (DR) is a representation of the reasoning
              behind the design of an artifact. In recent years, the use of
              semiformal notations for structuring arguments about design
              decisions has attracted much interest within the human-computer
              interaction and software engineering communities, leading to a
              number of DR notations and support environments. This paper
              examines two foundational claims made by argumentation-based DR
              approaches: that expressing DR as argumentation is useful, and
              that designers can use such notations. The conceptual and
              empirical basis for these claims is examined, firstly by
              surveying relevant literature on the use of argumentation in
              non-design contexts (from which current DR efforts draw much
              inspiration), and secondly, by surveying DR work. Evidence is
              classified according to the research contribution it makes, the
              kind of data on which claims are based (anecdotal or
              experimental), the extent to which the claims made are
              substantiated, and whether or not the users of the approach were
              also the researchers. In the survey, a trend towards tightly
              integrating DR with other design representations is noted, but it
              is argued that taken too far, this may result in the loss of the
              original vision of argumentative design. In examining the
              evidence for each claim, it is demonstrated firstly, that
              research into semiformal argumentation outside the design context
              has failed to substantiate convincingly either of the two claims
              implicitly attributed to it in current DR research, and secondly,
              that there are also significant gaps in the DR literature. There
              are emerging indications, however, that argumentation-based DR
              can assist certain kinds of design reasoning by turning the
              representational effort to the designer’s advantage, and that
              such DRs can be useful at a later date. This analysis of
              argumentation research sets an agenda for future work driven by a
              concern to support the designer in the whole process of
              externalising and structuring DR, from initially ill-formed ideas
              to more rigorous, coherent argumentation. The paper concludes by
              clarifying implications for the design of DR training, notations,
              and tools.",

  author   = "Pershin, Yuriy V and Di Ventra, Massimiliano",
  abstract = "When someone mentions the name of a known person we immediately
              recall her face and possibly many other traits. This is because
              we possess the so-called associative memory, that is the ability
              to correlate different memories to the same fact or event.
              Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing human
              ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our
              brain must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether
              electronic neural networks (electronic schemes that act somewhat
              similarly to human brains) can be built to perform this type of
              function. Although the field of neural networks has developed for
              many years, a key element, namely the synapses between adjacent
              neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic
              representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit
              element able to reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember
              its past dynamical history, store a continuous set of states, and
              be ``plastic'' according to the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic
              neuronal activity. Here we show that all this can be accomplished
              by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular, by
              using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have
              built a memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic
              properties. Most importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally
              the formation of associative memory in a simple neural network
              consisting of three electronic neurons connected by two
              memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration
              opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural
              processes using memory devices, an important step forward to
              reproduce complex learning, adaptive and spontaneous behaviour
              with electronic neural networks.",

              deployments over the past decade and has predicted a significant
              increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors
              continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order
              to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it.
              Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in

              Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in

              over-emphasised, and organisms considered as basically selfish.
              However, at the macromolecular level of genes and proteins the
              cooperative aspect of evolution is more obvious and balances this
              self-centred aspect. Thousands of proteins must function together
              in an integrated manner to use and to produce the many molecules
              necessary for a functioning cell. The macromolecules have no idea
              whether they are functioning cooperatively or competitively with
              other genes and gene products (such as proteins). The cell is a
              giant cooperative system of thousands of genes/proteins that
              function together, even if it has to simultaneously resist
              'parasites'. There are extensive examples of cooperative behavior

  abstract = "LR parsers can be made to run 6 to 10 times as fast as the best
              table-interpretive LR parsers. The resulting parse time is
              negligible compared to the time required by the remainder of a
              typical compiler containing the parser.A parsing speed of 1/2
              million lines per minute on a computer similar to a VAX 11/780
              was achieved, up from an interpretive speed of 40,000 lines per
              minute. A speed of 240,000 lines per minute on an Intel 80286 was
              achieved, up from an interpretive speed of 37,000 lines per
              minute.The improvement is obtained by translating the parser's
              finite state control into assembly language. States become code
              memory addresses. The current input symbol resides in a register
              and a quick sequence of register-constant comparisons determines
              the next state, which is merely jumped to. The parser's push-down
              stack is implemented directly on a hardware stack. The stack
              contains code memory addresses rather than the traditional state
              numbers.The strongly-connected components of the directed graph
              induced by the parser's terminal and nonterminal transitions are
              examined to determine a typically small subset of the states that
              require parse-time stack-overflow-check code when hardware does
              not provide the check automatically.The increase in speed is at
              the expense of space: a factor of 2 to 4 increase in total table
              size can be expected, depending upon whether syntactic error
              recovery is required.",

              immersion. While flow state is often discussed in the serious
              games literature, in-depth empirical examinations of flow state
              remain elusive. In this dissertation I addressed this need by
              conducting a thorough literature review of flow, serious games,
              and game-based learning in order to propose a new model of flow
              in games. Two studies were conducted in support of this model.
              The first experiment consisted of the creation and validation of
              a play experience scale. Based ib tge data frin 203 Study 1
              participants, the Play Experience Scale was validated for use
              with video games. The 14-item version of the Play Experience
              Scale was composed of the components of freedom, lack of
              extrinsic motivation, autotelic experience, and direct assessment
              of play. The scale was reliable, with a calculated $\alpha$ of
              .86. In the second study, the newly developed scale was used
              alongside an immune system serious game to examine the impact of
              play, in-game performance, and emotional experience on flow in
              games. In an effort to provude a more symmetrical version of the
              scale, two items were added to the scale, resulting in a 16-item
              revision. Based on the empirical results obtained from Study 2's
              77 participants, the proposed model of flow in games was revised
              slightly. Though Study 2 only examined a subset of the overall
              model of flow in games, the evidence suggested the model was a
              good theoretical match. Further, the two added items of the Play
              Experience Scale were valid, providing a final 16-item version of
              the scale. Play and in-game perormance were key predictors of
              game-based learning. Additionally, play, video game
              self-efficacy, and emotional experience exhibited a reciprocal
              relationship flow state. Implications for serious game
              development, scientific research into games and learning, and
              industry testing of game playability were provided. Following
              these implications, conclusions were presented alongside
              suggestions for further research.",

              used for modeling complex dynamical systems where the
              stochasticity and the delay of transitions are important
              features, such as in the case of biochemical reactions. Commonly,
              durations of transitions within stochastic $\varpi$-calculus
              models follow an exponential law. The underlying dynamics of such
              models are expressed in terms of continuous-time Markov chains,
              which can then be efficiently simulated and model-checked.
              However, the exponential law comes with a huge variance, making
              it difficult to model systems with accurate temporal constraints.
              In this paper, a technique for tuning temporal features within
              the stochastic $\varpi$-calculus is presented. This method relies
              on the introduction of a stochasticity absorption factor by

              real-world environments, participating agents need to reason not
              only about the specifications of the environment they inhabit,
              but also about their own knowledge concerning its current state
              by exploiting information acquired at run-time. Considering the
              highly dynamic nature of most complex domains, the study of
              knowledge evolution over time is a critical aspect. In this
              thesis, we develop a unified formal theory of action, knowledge
              and time using the language of the Event Calculus and automate
              the process of reasoning about a wide range of commonsense
              phenomena. Traditionally, epistemic reasoning has been structured
              around the highly ex- pressive but computationally expensive
              ``possible worlds'' specifications. Recent theories adopt
              alternative representations for knowledge, dismissing the
              accessibil- ity relation of possible worlds and promising more
              efficient reasoning in classes of restricted expressiveness. The
              framework we propose combines the full expressive power of the
              possible worlds semantics with the benefits of alternative
              approaches, building on a proper handling of a type of causal
              dependencies that emerge among partially known world aspects. We
              investigate the properties of these so called hidden causal
              dependencies and develop a provably sound and complete axiom-
              atization that is independent of the underlying formalism. We
              show correctness properties by studying the correlation of the
              theory with an epistemic formalism that implements the standard
              definition for knowledge, based on a recently pro- posed
              branching version of the Event Calculus. Furthermore, we
              investigate a number of different extensions of the basic
              axiomatization augmenting the mental state of intelligent agents
              with essential cognitive skills, such as the ability to remember
              and forget, to reason about physical actions, to handle complex
              ramifications in partially observable domains, and others. We
              demonstrate the potential of the theory by modeling complex
              benchmark problems proposed in relevant literature, as well as
              scenarios that emerge in the highly demanding nascent field of
              Ambient Intelligence. Finally, we also describe the design of a

              to enable the exploration of unconventional design concepts. In
              this context, given a large set of disciplinary analysis tools,

              addressing this problem based on the formalism of graph theory.

              scales and viceversa. Results generated by computational models
              can be applied to real life applications only if the models have
              been validated first. Traditional in silico model checking
              techniques only capture how non-dimensional properties (e.g.
              concentrations) evolve over time and are suitable for small scale
              systems (e.g. metabolic pathways). The validation of larger scale
              systems (e.g. multicellular populations) additionally requires
              capturing how spatial patterns and their properties change over
              time, which are not considered by traditional non-spatial
              approaches.ResultsWe developed and implemented a methodology for
              the automatic validation of computational models with respect to
              both their spatial and temporal properties. Stochastic biological
              systems are represented by abstract models which assume a linear
              structure of time and a pseudo-3D representation of space (2D
              space plus a density measure). Time series data generated by such
              models is provided as input to parameterised image processing
              modules which automatically detect and analyse spatial patterns
              (e.g. cell) and clusters of such patterns (e.g. cellular
              population). For capturing how spatial and numeric properties
              change over time the Probabilistic Bounded Linear Spatial
              Temporal Logic is introduced. Given a collection of time series
              data and a formal spatio-temporal specification the model checker
              Mudi (http://mudi.modelchecking.org) determines probabilistically
              if the formal specification holds for the computational model or
              not. Mudi is an approximate probabilistic model checking platform
              which enables users to choose between frequentist and Bayesian,
              estimate and statistical hypothesis testing based validation
              approaches. We illustrate the expressivity and efficiency of our
              approach based on two biological case studies namely phase
              variation patterning in bacterial colony growth and the
              chemotactic aggregation of cells.ConclusionsThe formal
              methodology implemented in Mudi enables the validation of
              computational models against spatio-temporal logic properties and
              is a precursor to the development and validation of more complex
              multidimensional and multiscale models.",

              evolve? Does the popularity of old blog posts drop exponentially
              with time? These are some of the questions that we address in
              this work. Our goal is to build a model that generates realistic
              cascades, so that it can help us with link prediction and outlier
              detection. Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of
              information because of their timely publication, ease of use, and
              wide availability. In fact, they often make headlines, by
              discussing and discovering evidence about political events and
              facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly
              available record of how information and influence spreads through
              an underlying social network. Aggregating links from several blog
              posts creates a directed graph which we analyze to discover the
              patterns of information propagation in blogspace, and thereby
              understand the underlying social network. Not only are blogs
              interesting on their own merit, but our analysis also sheds light
              on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and
              computer networks. Here we report some surprising findings of the
              blog linking and information propagation structure, after we
              analyzed one of the largest available datasets, with 45,000 blogs
              and ~ 2.2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also sheds light on
              how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer
              networks. We also present a simple model that mimics the spread
              of information on the blogosphere, and produces information
              cascades very similar to those found in real life.",

  abstract = "How can we model networks with a mathematically tractable model
              that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Networks
              exhibit a long list of surprising properties: heavy tails for the
              degree distribution; small diameters; and densification and
              shrinking diameters over time. Most present network models either
              fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to
              analyze mathematically, or both. In this paper we propose a
              generative model for networks that is both mathematically
              tractable and can generate networks that have the above mentioned
              properties. Our main idea is to use the Kronecker product to
              generate graphs that we refer to as ``Kronecker graphs''. First,
              we prove that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network
              properties. We also provide empirical evidence showing that
              Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real
              networks. We then present KronFit, a fast and scalable algorithm
              for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real
              networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-
              exponential time. In contrast, KronFit takes linear time, by
              exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and
              by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on large
              real and synthetic networks show that KronFit finds accurate
              parameters that indeed very well mimic the properties of target
              networks. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain
              insights about the network structure, and the resulting synthetic
              graphs can be used for null- models, anonymization,
              extrapolations, and graph summarization.",

              Self-reports of HIV testing, knowledge, attitudes, and high-risk
              acts were examined among 272 adolescents aged 13-23 years (M =
              18.7; SD = 2.3) attending community-based agencies that serve
              youth at high risk for HIV in Los Angeles, New York City, and San
              Francisco. Results: Evidence of adolescents' risk for HIV is
              reflected in a rate of 4.8\% seropositivity, 24\% injecting drug
              use, a mean of 4.3 (SD = 11.6) sexual partners during the
              previous 3 months, and 71\% condom use during vaginal/anal sex.
              HIV testing was common (63\%) and often repeated (M = 3.6, SD =
              4.0). Knowledge of the meaning and consequences of testing was
              high (84\% correct). Contrary to service providers' expectations,
              youth were likely to return for their test results (90\%
              returned). Youth who were older, labeled themselves gay or
              bisexual, lived in Los Angeles or San Francisco, and those who
              injected drugs were significantly more likely, compared to peers,
              to get tested for HIV. Conclusions: These results suggest a need
              for more detailed observational studies of HIV testing behavior
              that include evaluation of characteristics of the youth, the
              testing site, and the attitudes and beliefs of providers offering

  abstract  = "Background: ``The graying of the globe'' has resulted in
               exponential rise in health care expenses, over-worked health
               care professionals and a growing patient base suffering from
               multiple chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Consumer
               health technologies (CHT) are considered important catalysts for
               empowering health care consumers to take a proactive role in
               managing their health and related costs. Adoption rate and
               usability of such devices among the aging is far from being
               satisfactory. Past studies noted the motivation for adoption by
               the aging is dependent on the suitability/relevance, perceived
               usability and anticipated benefits associated with usage of
               technological innovation. Traditional information technology
               (IT) development adopts a systematic approach without
               necessarily using a specific user model that personalizes the
               system to the aging user groups. The aging patient population
               has unique needs arising from progressive deterioration in both
               physiological and psychological abilities. These needs are often
               ignored in the design, development, trial and adoption of
               consumer health products resulting in low adoption and usage.
               Objectives: The main objective of this research is to
               investigate the user-centered design (UCD), specifically user
               profiles and personas, as methodological tools to inform the
               design and development of CHT devices for an aging population.
               The adoption of user profile and persona has not received much
               attention in health care informatics research and, in
               particular, research involving CHT. Our work begins to fill this
               void in three ways. We (1) illuminate the process of developing
               CHT user profiles and personas for a Chinese elder population
               with a demanding health care needs, i.e., self-management of
               chronic diabetes, with the hope that the resulting profiles and
               personas may be used as foundational material for informing the
               design, development and evaluation of CHT in other similar
               contexts; (2) call attention to how to further enhance and
               complement traditional user profile and persona techniques for
               CHT design by integrating cognitive structures and present
               behavior that drive health care thinking, future behavior and
               demand; (3) show how the profiles and personas can be used to
               inform requirements, design and implementation decisions for a
               technology aimed at facilitating CHT adoption and diffusion for
               the elderly. Methodology: To exemplify process and application,
               we use an action-research methodology, where user profiles and
               personas of an aging patient population were developed. The
               resultant profiles and personas were leveraged to improve the
               design, development and implementation plans of a smart phone
               application to assist chronically ill aging Chinese diabetic
               population capable of disease self-management. Results: The
               results from the study show that user profile and persona can be
               a valuable methodological approach in capturing the conceptual
               model of the aging and informing the design and development
               decisions of CHT. The demonstration of techniques used in this
               study can serve as a guideline to CHT developers in bringing
               conceptual user modeling into the design of software interfaces
               targeted for users with specific health care needs.
               Specifically, the study provides guidance on the creation and
               use of profiles and personas to tap into the conceptual models
               of the targeted elderly population reflecting their preferences,
               capabilities and attitudes towards using technology in
               self-management care in general and the smart phone diabetes
               management application in particular. Insight into the mental
               model of the aging group has been shown to inform later stages
               of UCD development (e.g., the creation of prototypes and
               usability testing) as well as implementation and adoption
               strategies. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by
               2025, 80\% of all new cases of diabetes are expected to appear
               in the developing countries. In fact, the number of diabetic
               patients in China is estimated to rise to 42.3 million in 2030
               from 20.8 million in 2000. Thus, we investigate the Chinese
               aging population in order to demonstrate the process of
               developing and using user profile and persona. We hope that the
               resultant conceptual model of the Chinese aging diabetic
               population can be used in future research to guide CHT designers
               interested in designing health care devices for this vulnerable
               user group. \copyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",

  author   = "Leman, Patrick J and Cinnirella, Marco",
  abstract = "An important component of conspiracy theories is how they
              influence, and are influenced by, the evaluation of potential
              evidence. Some individuals may be more open minded regarding
              certain explanations for events whereas others may seek closure
              and thus cut off a conspiracy explanation. Two studies examined
              the relationship between the need for cognitive closure (NFCC),
              levels of belief in real world conspiracy theories, and the
              attribution of conspiracy theories to explain events. A first,
              small (N = 30) and preliminary study found no relationship
              between NFCC and beliefs in conspiracy theories, suggesting that
              both advocates and opponents of conspiracy explanations do not
              differ on this dimension. A second study (N = 86) revealed that
              evidence for and against conspiracy theories had an influence on
              attributions of the likelihood of a conspiracy to explain a novel
              event. Specifically, after reading evidence individuals with high
              levels of belief in conspiracy theories tended to rate a
              conspiracy explanation as more likely whereas those with low
              levels of belief rated it as less likely. However, when the need

              advanced tools to store, manipulate, reason about the knowledge
              acquired by the robot has been made clear. But storing and
              manipulating knowledge requires first to understand what the
              knowledge itself means to the robot and how to represent it in a
              machine-processable way. This work strives first at providing a
              systematic study of the knowl- edge requirements of modern
              robotic applications in the context of service robotics and
              human-robot interaction. What are the expressiveness require-
              ment for a robot? What are its needs in term of reasoning
              techniques? What are the requirement on the robot’s knowledge
              processing structure induced by other cognitive functions like
              perception or decision making?We propose a novel typology of
              desirable features for knowledge representation systems supported
              by an extensive review of existing tools in our community. In a
              second part, the thesis presents in depth a particular
              instantiation of a knowledge representation and manipulation
              system called ORO, that has been designed and implemented during
              the preparation of the thesis. We elaborate on the inner working
              of this system, as well as its integration into several complete
              robot control stacks. A particular focus is given to the
              modelling of agent-dependent symbolic perspectives and their
              relations to theories of mind. The third part of the study is
              focused on the presentation of one im- portant application of
              knowledge representation systems in the human- robot interaction
              context: situated dialogue. Our approach and associated
              algorithms leading to the interactive grounding of unconstrained

              databases fit into RAM. For main-memory database systems, index
              structure performance is a critical bottleneck. Traditional
              in-memory data structures like balanced binary search trees are
              not efficient on modern hardware, because they do not optimally
              utilize on-CPU caches. Hash tables, also often used for
              main-memory indexes, are fast but only support point queries. To
              overcome these shortcomings, we present ART, an adaptive radix
              tree (trie) for efficient indexing in main memory. Its lookup
              performance surpasses highly tuned, read-only search trees, while
              supporting very efficient insertions and deletions as well. At

              of excessive worst-case space consumption, which plagues most
              radix trees, by adaptively choosing compact and efficient data
              structures for internal nodes. Even though ART’s performance is
              comparable to hash tables, it maintains the data in sorted order,

              currently the most relevant is an important task in information
              visualization. The same problem exists in photography, where a
              number of solutions have been known for a long time. One of these
              methods is depth of field (DOF), which depicts objects in or out
              of focus depending on their distance from the camera. We propose
              the generalization of this idea to a concept we call semantic
              depth of field (SDOF), where the sharpness of objects is
              controlled by their current relevance, rather than their
              distance. This enables the user to quickly switch between
              different sets of criteria without having to get used to a
              different visualization layout or geometric distortion. We
              present several visual metaphors based on SDOF and show examples
              of their use. Because DOF is widely used in photography and
              cinematography, SDOF should be easy to understand for most users.

              Instead, they have many non-scientific alternative conceptions to
              explain different aspects of rock formation. Using 10 interviews
              and nearly 200 questionnaires filled out by students at four
              different colleges, we identified many alternative conceptions
              students have about rock formation. We then used themes within
              those alternative conceptions to identify the underlying
              conceptual barriers that cause them. Conceptual barriers are
              deeply-held conceptions that prevent students from understanding
              scientific explanations. One conceptual barrier can cause many
              alternative conceptions, and alternative conceptions can be the
              result of more than one conceptual barrier. The seven conceptual
              barriers identified in the study that prevent students from
              understanding rock formation are Deep Time, Changing Earth, Large
              Spatial Scale, Bedrock, Materials, Atomic Scale, and Pressure.
              Because of these conceptual barriers, students cannot form
              scientifically correct mental models of how rocks form, resulting
              in alternative conceptions, so the conceptual barriers need to be
              overcome before students truly learn the scientific explanations

              reinforcement learning and examine how it could have evolved from
              the same basic associative elements. We use agent-based computer

               method. It is widely applied to clustering problems and data
               exploration in industry, finance, natural sciences, and
               linguistics. The most extensive applications, exemplified in
               this paper, can be found in the management of massive textual
               databases and in bioinformatics. The SOM is related to the
               classical vector quantization (VQ), which is used extensively in
               digital signal processing and transmission. Like in VQ, the SOM
               represents a distribution of input data items using a finite set
               of models. In the SOM, however, these models are automatically
               associated with the nodes of a regular (usually two-dimensional)
               grid in an orderly fashion such that more similar models become
               automatically associated with nodes that are adjacent in the
               grid, whereas less similar models are situated farther away from
               each other in the grid. This organization, a kind of similarity
               diagram of the models, makes it possible to obtain an insight
               into the topographic relationships of data, especially of
               high-dimensional data items. If the data items belong to certain
               predetermined classes, the models (and the nodes) can be
               calibrated according to these classes. An unknown input item is
               then classified according to that node, the model of which is
               most similar with it in some metric used in the construction of
               the SOM. A new finding introduced in this paper is that an input
               item can even more accurately be represented by a linear mixture
               of a few best-matching models. This becomes possible by a
               least-squares fitting procedure where the coefficients in the
               linear mixture of models are constrained to nonnegative values.

              shown to be linked to a particular algebraic structure, called
              valuation algebra. There are many models of this algebraic
              structure ranging from probability theory to numerical analysis,
              relational databases and various classical and non-classical
              logics. It turns out that many interesting models of valuation
              algebras may be derived from semiring valued mappings. In this
              paper we study how valuation algebras are induced by semirings
              and how the structure of the valuation algebra is related to the
              algebraic structure of the semiring. In particular, c-semirings
              with idempotent multiplication induce idempotent valuation
              algebras and therefore permit particularly efficient
              architectures for local computation. Also important are semirings
              whose multiplicative semigroup is embedded in a union of groups.
              They induce valuation algebras with a partially defined division.
              For these valuation algebras, the well-known architectures for
              Bayesian networks apply. We also extend the general computational
              framework to allow derivation of bounds and approximations, for

  abstract = "We propose a type-based resource usage analysis for the
              (pi)-calculus extended with resource creation/access primitives.
              The goal of the resource usage analysis is to statically check
              that a program accesses resources such as files and memory in a
              valid manner. Our type system is an extension of previous
              behavioral type systems for the pi-calculus, and can guarantee
              the safety property that no invalid access is performed, as well
              as the property that necessary accesses (such as the close
              operation for a file) are eventually performed unless the program
              diverges. A sound type inference algorithm for the type system is
              also developed to free the programmer from the burden of writing
              complex type annotations. Based on the algorithm, we have
              implemented a prototype resource usage analyzer for the
              $\varpi$-calculus. To the authors’ knowledge, ours is the first
              type-based resource usage analysis that deals with an expressive
              concurrent language like the $\varpi$-calculus.",

              paper, we define LR(k) grammars, which are perhaps the most

              understanding all of the special tricks which have been used in
              the construction of parsing algorithms for languages with simple
              structure, e.g. algebraic languages. We give algorithms for
              deciding if a given grammar satisfies the LR(k) condition, for
              given k, and also give methods for generating recognizes for
              LR(k) grammars. It is shown that the problem of whether or not a
              grammar is LR(k) for some k is undecidable, and the paper
              concludes by establishing various connections between LR(k)

              rethinking of database systems design. Developers should be able
              to leverage high-level programming languages without having to
              pay a price in efficiency. To realize our vision of abstraction
              without regret, we present LegoBase, a query engine written in
              the high-level pro- gramming language Scala. The key technique to
              regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: the Scala
              code that constitutes the query engine, despite its high-level
              appearance, is actually a program generator that emits
              specialized, low-level C code. We show how the combination of
              high-level and generative program- ming allows to easily
              implement a wide spectrum of optimizations that are difficult to
              achieve with existing low-level query compilers, and how it can
              continuously optimize the query engine. We evaluate our approach
              with the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) with all

              outperforms a commercial in-memory database system as well as an
              existing query compiler, (b) these performance improve- ments

              instead of complicated low-level code that is required by exist-
              ing query compilers and, finally, that (c) the compilation

              knowledge given the inherent complexity and dynamics of human

              rich histories in applying computational approaches to translate
              data obtained from complex systems into knowledge of system
              behavior. However, there are some differences in how disciplines
              approach problems. By referring to mathematical models as
              mathematical prototypes, we aim to highlight aspects related to
              the process (i.e., prototyping) rather than the product (i.e.,

              challenge in translating data into improved knowledge of basic
              immunology that can be used to improve therapies for disease.
              These concepts are illustrated using two immunology-related
              examples. The prototypes presented focus on the beta cell mass at

  abstract = "Formal models serve in many roles in the programming language
              community. In its primary role, a model communicates the idea of
              a language design; the architecture of a language tool; or the
              essence of a program analysis. No matter which role it plays,
              however, a faulty model doesn't serve its purpose. One way to
              eliminate flaws from a model is to write it down in a mechanized
              formal language. It is then possible to state theorems about the
              model, to prove them, and to check the proofs. Over the past nine
              years, PLT has developed and explored a lightweight version of
              this approach, dubbed Redex. In a nutshell, Redex is a
              domain-specific language for semantic models that is embedded in
              the Racket programming language. The effort of creating a model
              in Redex is often no more burdensome than typesetting it with

              experience of solving problems, they can learn both content and
              thinking strategies. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an
              instructional method in which students learn through facilitated
              problem solving. In PBL, student learning centers on a complex
              problem that does not have a single correct answer. Students work
              in collaborative groups to identify what they need to learn in
              order to solve a problem. They engage in self-directed learning
              (SDL) and then apply their new knowledge to the problem and
              reflect on what they learned and the effectiveness of the
              strategies employed. The teacher acts to facilitate the learning
              process rather than to provide knowledge. The goals of PBL
              include helping students develop 1) flexible knowledge, 2)
              effective problem-solving skills, 3) SDL skills, 4) effective
              collaboration skills, and 5) intrinsic motivation. This article
              discusses the nature of learning in PBL and examines the
              empirical evidence supporting it. There is considerable research
              on the first 3 goals of PBL but little on the last 2. Moreover,
              minimal research has been conducted outside medical and gifted
              education. Understanding how these goals are achieved with less
              skilled learners is an important part of a research agenda for
              PBL. The evidence suggests that PBL is an instructional approach

              particularly relevant in understanding biological systems because
              an important domain principle is the relation between form,
              function, and mechanism. Our results demonstrated that there were

  abstract = "Iterated games are a fundamental component of economic and
              evolutionary game theory. They describe situations where two
              players interact repeatedly and have the ability to use
              conditional strategies that depend on the outcome of previous
              interactions, thus allowing for reciprocation. Recently, a new
              class of strategies has been proposed, so-called
              ``zero-determinant'' strategies. These strategies enforce a fixed
              linear relationship between one's own payoff and that of the
              other player. A subset of those strategies allows
              ``extortioners'' to ensure that any increase in one player's own
              payoff exceeds that of the other player by a fixed percentage.
              Here, we analyze the evolutionary performance of this new class
              of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations, they
              can act as catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to
              tit-for-tat, but that they are not the stable outcome of natural
              selection. In very small populations, however, extortioners hold
              their ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well in
              coevolutionary arms races between two distinct populations.
              Significantly, they benefit the population that evolves at the
              slower rate, an example of the so-called ``Red King'' effect.

  abstract = "This research-in-progress report describes ongoing work on a
              doctoral disserta- tion, which attempts to model the prototypical
              structure of the tourist brochure as a multimodal artefact. By
              using a multimodal corpus based on the Genre and Multimodality
              model, the dissertation investigates how the brochures use both
              language and image to fulfil their communicative function. This
              article focuses on a specific aspect of the prototypical
              structure, that is, how the brochures organize the content in the
              layout and signal its interrelations. The article sug- gests that
              the layout and the rhetorical relations between the content are
              inter- twined in what may be called the ‘rhetoric-layout
              interface’. By drawing on a sample of three brochures published
              in 1984, 1988, and 2006, the article explores how this interface
              shapes the multimodal structure of the tourist brochures. The
              relationship between the rhetorical and the layout structure is
              suggested to be reciprocal: adopting a particular configuration
              in the rhetorical structure also affects the range of choices
              available in the layout structure and vice versa. The article
              concludes that the interface between the rhetorical and the
              layout structure warrants attention in modeling the prototypical
              structure, and suggests that certain structural signals related
              to the use of two-dimensional space require specific attention in
              corpus analysis. Moreover, extensive cross-layer analyses with
              larger corpora will be required to tease out the range of
              different configur-ations in the tourist brochures, and to create
              a prototypical model of the multi-modal artefact.",

  title    = "The science of self-organization and adaptativity",
  author   = "Heylighen, Francis",
  abstract = "The theory of self-organization and adaptivity has grown out of a
              variety of disciplines, including thermodynamics, cybernetics and
              computer modelling. The present article reviews its most
              important concepts and principles. It starts with an intuitive
              overview, illustrated by the examples of magnetization and
              B\'{e}nard convection, and concludes with the basics of
              mathematical modelling. Self-organization can be defined as the
              spontaneous creation of a globally coherent pattern out of local
              interactions. Because of its distributed character, this
              organization tends to be robust, resisting perturbations. The
              dynamics of a self-organizing system is typically non-linear,
              because of circular or feedback relations between the components.
              Positive feedback leads to an explosive growth, which ends when
              all components have been absorbed into the new configuration,
              leaving the system in a stable, negative feedback state.
              Non-linear systems have in general several stable states, and
              this number tends to increase (bifurcate) as an increasing input
              of energy pushes the system farther from its thermodynamic
              equilibrium. To adapt to a changing environment, the system needs
              a variety of stable states that is large enough to react to all
              perturbations but not so large as to make its evolution
              uncontrollably chaotic. The most adequate states are selected
              according to their fitness, either directly by the environment,
              or by subsystems that have adapted to the environment at an
              earlier stage. Formally, the basic mechanism underlying
              self-organization is the (often noise-driven) variation which
              explores different regions in the system’s state space until it
              enters an attractor. This precludes further variation outside the
              attractor, and thus restricts the freedom of the system’s
              components to behave independently. This is equivalent to the
              increase of coherence, or decrease of statistical entropy, that
              defines selforganization.",

              Explaining how these mechanisms interact across scales and how
              events are coordinated in space and time is necessary for a
              complete understanding of somitogenesis and its evolutionary
              flexibility. So far, mechanisms of somitogenesis have been
              studied independently. To test the consistency, integrability and
              combined explanatory power of current prevailing hypotheses, we
              built an integrated clock-and-wavefront model including submodels

              massive DNA sequences.. The method is based on a perceptual hash
              function, commonly used to determine the similarity between
              digital images, that we adapted for DNA sequences. Perceptual
              hash function presented here is based on a Discrete Cosine
              Transform Sign Only (DCT-SO). Each nucleotide is encoded as a
              fixed gray level intensity pixel and the hash is calculated from
              its significant frequency characteristics. This results to a
              drastic data reduction between the sequence and the perceptual
              hash. Unlike cryptographic hash functions, perceptual hashes are
              not affected by ``avalanche effect'' and thus can be compared.
              The similarity distance between two hashes is estimated with the
              Hamming Distance, which is used to retrieve DNA sequences.
              Experiments that we conducted show that our approach is relevant
              for storing massive DNA sequences, and retrieving them.",

              growth and development of multicellular organisms. These forces
              not only affect the size and shape of the cells and tissues but
              are capable of modifying the expression of genes and the
              localization of molecular components within the cell, in the
              plasma membrane, and in the plant cell wall. The magnitude and
              direction of these physical forces change with cellular and
              tissue properties such as elasticity. Thus, mechanical forces and
              the mesoscopic fields that emerge from their local action
              constitute important sources of positional information. Moreover,
              physical and biochemical processes interact in non-linear ways
              during tissue and organ growth in plants and animals. In this
              review we discuss how such mechanical forces are generated,
              transmitted, and sensed in these two lineages of multicellular
              organisms to yield long-range positional information. In order to
              do so we first outline a potentially common basis for studying
              patterning and mechanosensing that relies on the structural
              principle of tensegrity, and discuss how tensegral structures
              might arise in plants and animals. We then provide some examples
              of morphogenesis in which mechanical forces appear to act as
              positional information during development, offering a possible
              explanation for ubiquitous processes, such as the formation of
              periodic structures. Such examples, we argue, can be interpreted
              in terms of tensegral phenomena. Finally, we discuss the
              hypothesis of mechanically isotropic points as a potentially
              generic mechanism for the localization and maintenance of
              stem-cell niches in multicellular organisms. This comparative
              approach aims to help uncovering generic mechanisms of
              morphogenesis and thus reach a better understanding of the
              evolution and development of multicellular phenotypes, focusing

              (DPMs) provides a framework for studying developmental processes
              in the context of wide comparative analyses. DPMs are defined as
              sets of ancient, conserved gene products and molecular networks,
              in conjunction with the physical morphogenetic and patterning
              processes they mobilize in the context of multicellularity. The
              theoretical framework based on DPMs originally postulated that

              animal body plans and organ forms. Here, we use a previous

              advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived
              predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP

              space of world states of a planning task in the forward
              direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast
              Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a

  abstract = "Online social networks evolved into a global mainstream medium
              that generates an increasing social and economic impact. However,
              many online social networks face the question how to leverage on
              their fast growing popularity to achieve sustainable revenues. In
              that context, particularly more effective advertising strategies
              and sophisticated customer loyalty programs to foster users’
              retention are needed. Thereby, key users in terms of users’
              connectivity and communication activity play a decisive role.
              However, quantitative approaches for the identification of key
              users in online social networks merging concepts and findings
              from research on users’ connectivity and communication activity
              are missing. Based on the design science research paradigm, we
              therefore propose a novel PageRank based approach bringing
              together both research streams. To demonstrate its practical
              applicability, we use a publicly available dataset of
              Facebook.com. Finally, we evaluate our novel PageRank based
              approach in comparison to existing approaches, which could
              alternatively be used.",

  abstract = "The effects of computer animations and mental animation on
              people’s mental models of a mechanical system are examined. In 3
              experiments, students learned how a mechanical system works from
              various instructional treatments including viewing a static
              diagram of the machine, predicting motion from static diagrams,
              viewing computer animations, and viewing static and animated
              diagrams accompanied by verbal commentaries. Although students’
              understanding of the system was improved by viewing both static
              and animated diagrams, there was no evidence that animated
              diagrams led to superior understanding of dynamic processes
              compared to static diagrams. Comprehension of diagrams was
              enhanced by asking students questions that required them to
              predict the behavior of the machine from static diagrams and by
              providing them with a verbal description of the dynamic
              processes. This article proposes that predicting motion from
              static diagrams engages students’ mental animation processes,
              including spatial visualization, and provides them with
              information about what they do and do not understand about how
              the machine works. Verbal instruction provides information that
              is not easily communicated in graphics and directs students’
              attention to the relevant information in static and animated
              diagrams. The research suggests that an understanding of

              composed of both SSD-based file servers (SServer) and HDD-based

  abstract  = "The Cambrian explosion is probably the most spectacular
               diversification in evolutionary history, and understanding it
               has been a challenge for biologists since the time of Darwin. We
               propose that one of the key factors that drove this great
               diversification was associative learning. Although the
               evolutionary emergence of associative learning required only
               small modifications in already existing memory mechanisms and
               may have occurred in parallel in several groups, once this type
               of learning appeared on the evolutionary scene, it led to
               extreme diversifying selection at the ecological level: it
               enabled animals to exploit new niches, promoted new types of
               relations and arms races, and led to adaptive responses that
               became fixed through genetic accommodation processes. This
               learning-based diversification was accompanied by neurohormonal
               stress, which led to an ongoing destabilization and
               re-patterning of the epigenome, which, in turn, enabled further
               morphological, physiological, and behavioral diversification.
               Our hypothesis combines several previous ideas about the
               dynamics of the Cambrian explosion and provides a unifying
               framework that includes both ecological and genomic factors. We
               conclude by suggesting research directions that would clarify
               the timing and manner in which associative learning evolved, and
               the effects it had on the evolution of nervous systems, genomes,
               and animal morphology. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",

  abstract  = "Deciding what question to branch on at each node is a key
               element of search algorithms. In this paper, we describe a
               collection of techniques for branching decisions that are
               motivated from an information-theoretic perspective. The idea is
               to drive the search to reduce the uncertainty (entropy) in the
               current subproblem. We present four families of methods for
               branch question selection in mixed integer programming that use
               this idea. In the first, a variable to branch on is selected
               based on lookahead. This method performs comparably to strong
               branching on MIPLIB, and better than strong branching on hard
               real-world procurement optimization instances on which CPLEX’s
               default strong branching outperforms CPLEX’s default branching
               strategy. The second family combines this idea with strong
               branching. The third family does not use lookahead, but instead
               exploits the tie between indicator variables and the variables
               they govern. This significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
               branching strategies on both combinatorial procurement problems
               and facility location problems. The fourth family concerns

              part. The relationship between TEs and experiments (Es) is

  abstract = "Model checking is an automated technique for checking that a
              system satisfies a set of required properties. With
              explicit-state model checkers, properties are typically defined
              in linear-time temporal logic (LTL), and are translated into
              B{\"{u}}chi automata in order to be checked. This paper describes
              how, by labeling automata transitions rather than states, we
              significantly reduce the size of automata generated by existing
              tableau-based translation algorithms. Our optimizations apply to
              the core of the translation process, where generalized

              and cognitive treatments of strategic reasoning in games. There
              have been extensive formal debates about the merits of the
              principle of backward induction among game theorists and
              logicians. Experimental economists and psychologists have shown
              that human subjects, perhaps due to their bounded resources, do
              not always follow the backward induction strategy, leading to
              unexpected outcomes. Recently, based on an eye-tracking study, it
              has turned out that even human subjects who produce the outwardly
              correct 'backward induction answer' use a different internal
              reasoning strategy to achieve it. The paper presents a formal
              language to represent different strategies on a finer-grained
              level than was possible before. The language and its semantics
              help to precisely distinguish different cognitive reasoning
              strategies, that can then be tested on the basis of computational
              cognitive models and experiments with human subjects. The

  abstract = "This dissertation presents algorithms for data structures called
              distributed hash tables (DHT) or structured overlay networks,
              which are used to build scalable self-managing distributed
              systems. The provided algorithms guarantee lookup consistency in
              the presence of dynamism: they guarantee con- sistent lookup
              results in the presence of nodes joining and leaving. Similarly,
              the algorithms guarantee that routing never fails while nodes
              join and leave. Previ- ous algorithms for lookup consistency
              either suffer from starvation, do not work in the presence of
              failures, or lack proof of correctness. Several group
              communication algorithms for structured overlay networks T are
              presented. We provide an overlay broadcast algorithm, which
              unlike previ- ous algorithms avoids redundant messages, reaching
              all nodes in O(logn) time, while using O(n) messages, where n is
              the number of nodes in the system. The broadcast algorithm is
              used to build overlay multicast.\textbackslash{}nWe introduce
              bulk operation, which enables a node to efficiently make multi-
              ple lookups or send a message to all nodes in a specified set of
              identifiers. The algorithm ensures that all specified nodes are
              reached in O(log n) time, sending maximum O(logn) messages per
              node, regardless of the input size of the bulk operation.
              Moreover, the algorithm avoids sending redundant messages. Previ-
              ous approaches required multiple lookups, which consume more
              messages and can render the initiator a bottleneck. Our
              algorithms are used in DHT-based storage systems, where nodes can
              do thousands of lookups to fetch large files. We use the bulk
              operation algorithm to construct a pseudo-reliable broadcast
              algorithm. Bulk operations can also be used to implement
              efficient range queries. Finally, we describe a novel way to
              place replicas in a DHT, called symmetric replication, that
              enables parallel recursive lookups. Parallel lookups are known to
              reduce latencies. However, costly iterative lookups have
              previously been used to do parallel lookups. Moreover, joins or
              leaves only require exchanging O(1) messages, while other schemes
              require at least log( f ) messages for a replication degree of f
              . The algorithms have been implemented in a middleware called the

  abstract = "In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical
              reinforcement learning (HRL) to speed up the acquisition of
              cooperative multiagent tasks. We introduce a hierarchical
              multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) framework and propose a
              hierarchical multi- agent RL algorithm called Cooperative HRL. In
              our approach, agents are cooperative and homogeneous (use the
              same task decomposition). Learning is decentralized, with each
              agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform
              subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with
              other agents. We deﬁne cooperative subtasks to be those subtasks
              in which coordination among agents signiﬁcantly improves the
              performance of the overall task. Those levels of the hierarchy
              which include cooperative subtasks are called cooperation levels.
              Since coordination at high levels allows for increased
              cooperation skills as agents do not get confused by low-level
              details, we usually deﬁne cooperative subtasks at the high levels
              of the hierarchy. This hierarchical approach allows agents to
              learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of
              cooperative subtasks, rather than attempting to learn
              coordination at the level of primitive actions. We use two
              experimental testbeds to study the empirical performance of the
              Cooperative HRL algorithm. One domain is a simulated two-robot
              trash collection task. The other domain is a much larger
              four-agent automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem. We
              compare the performance of the Cooperative HRL with selﬁsh HRL,
              as well as single-agent HRL and standard Q-learning algorithms.
              In the AGV scheduling domain, we also show that the Cooperative
              HRL outperforms widely used industrial heuristics, such as ``ﬁrst
              come ﬁrst serve'', ``highest queue ﬁrst'' and ``nearest station
              ﬁrst''. Later in this paper, we address the issue of rational
              communication behavior among autonomous agents. The goal is for
              agents to learn both action and com- munication policies that
              together optimize the task given the communication cost. We
              extend the Cooperative HRL algorithm to include communication
              decisions and propose a cooperative multiagent HRL algorithm
              called COM-Cooperative HRL. In this algorithm, we add a
              communication level to the hierarchical decomposition of the
              problem below each cooperation level. Before making a decision at
              a cooperative subtask, agents decide if it is worthwhile to
              perform a communication action. A com- munication action has a
              certain cost and provides each agent at a certain cooperation
              level with the actions selected by the other agents at the same
              level. We demonstrate the eﬃcacy of the COM-Cooperative HRL
              algorithm as well as the relation between the communication cost
              and the learned communication policy using a multiagent taxi
              problem.",

  abstract = "Existing approaches to narrative construction tend to apply basic
              engineering principles of system design which rely on identifying
              the most relevant feature of the domain for the problem at hand,
              and postulating an initial representation of the problem space
              organised around such a principal feature. Some features that
              have been favoured in the past include: causality, linear
              discourse, underlying structure, and character behavior. The
              present paper defends the need for simultaneous consideration of
              as many as possible of these aspects when attempting to model the
              process of creating narratives, together with some mechanism for
              distributing the weight of the decision processes across them.
              Humans faced with narrative construction may shift from views
              based on characters to views based on structure, then consider
              causality, and later also take into account the shape of
              discourse. This behavior can be related to the process of
              representational re-description of constraints as described in
              existing literature on cognitive models of the writing task. The
              paper discusses how existing computational models of narrative
              construction address this phenomenon, and argues for a

              acted as inspiration for several story generation systems, both

              are several particular methods for coping with complexity, but
              there is no general approach to build complex systems. In this
              thesis I propose a methodology to aid engineers in the design and
              control of complex systems. This is based on the description of
              systems as self-organizing. Starting from the agent metaphor, the
              methodology proposes a conceptual framework and a series of steps
              to follow to ﬁnd proper mechanisms that will promote elements to
              ﬁnd solutions by actively interacting among themselves. The main
              premise of the methodology claims that reducing the ``friction''
              of interactions between elements of a system will result in a
              higher ``satisfaction'' of the system, i.e. better performance. A
              general introduction to complex thinking is given, since
              designing self-organizing systems requires a non-classical
              thought, while practical notions of complexity and
              self-organization are put forward. To illustrate the methodology,
              I present three case studies. Self-organizing trafﬁc light
              controllers are proposed and studied with multi-agent
              simulations, outperforming traditional methods. Methods for
              improving communication within self-organizing bureaucracies are
              advanced, introducing a simple computational model to illustrate
              the beneﬁts of self-organization. In the last case study,
              requirements for self-organizing artifacts in an ambient
              intelligence scenario are discussed. Philosophical implications

  abstract = "We present numerical simulations of isolated disk galaxies
              including gas dynamics and star formation. The gas is allowed to
              cool to 10K, while heating of the gas is provided by the
              far-ultraviolet flux of all stars. Stars are allowed to form from
              the gas according to a Jeans instability criterion: gas is
              unstable when the Jeans mass is smaller than a critical mass, and
              stars form as soon as the gas remains unstable longer than the
              collapse time. With these ingredients we are able to create a
              two-phase interstellar medium and our model gives realistic star
              formation rates (SFRs). We investigate the influence of free
              parameters on the star formation. In order of decreasing
              importance these are: ionization fraction of the gas (determines
              the cooling properties), initial mass function (controls the heat
              input for the gas), collapse time for molecular clouds, and star
              formation efficiency. In the simulations the star formation
              quickly settles a kind of thermal equilibrium of the ISM. This
              result strongly favours the self-regulating mechanism for star
              formation. The model yields a Schmidt law power dependence of the
              SFR on gas density (SFR\{prop.to\}$\varrho$^n^) with index
              n=~1.3, in good agreement with observations. The simulations show
              that star formation can only occur in the mid-plane of the
              galaxy, where the gas is dense enough to cool below 100K. The gas
              above the plane and outside approximately 6 radial scale lengths
              is always warm (T>8000K), heated by the stellar photons. It
              suggests that radial truncation of stellar disks is a thermal
              rather than a dynamical process. Flocculent spiral structure is
              generally found in the cold gas and consequently also in the
              young stellar population. It suggests that flocculent spirals are
              due to the dissipational nature of gas.",

              formulation of finite elements provide an attractive means for
              the simulation of deformable bodies exhibiting linear elastic
              response. The separation of rigid body motions from the total
              element motions using purely geometric methods or polar
              decomposition of the deformation gradi- ent, however, can
              introduce instabilities for large element rotations and
              deformations. Furthermore, the integration of the corotational
              formulation into dynamic multigrid elasticity simulations
              requires to continually rebuild con- sistent system matrices at
              different resolution levels. The computational load imposed by
              these updates prohibits the use of large numbers of finite
              elements at rates comparable to the small-strain finite element
              formulation. To overcome the first problem, we present a new
              method to extract the rigid body motion from total finite element
              displacements based on energy minimization. This results in a
              very stable corotational formulation that only slightly increases
              the computational overhead. We address the second problem by
              introducing a novel algorithm for computing sparse products of
              the form RKRT, as they have to be evaluated to update the
              multigrid hierarchy. By reformulating the probleminto the
              simultaneous processing of a sequential data and control stream,
              cachemiss penalties are significantly reduced. Even though the
              algorithm increases memory requirements, it accelerates the
              multigrid FE simulation by a factor of up to 4 compared to
              previous multigrid approaches. Due to the proposed improvements,
              finite element deformable body simulations using the corotational
              formulation can be performed at rates of 17 tps for up to 12k

              atomic physics, quantum chemistry and cosmology. Quantum
              simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also
              with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and
              therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum
              systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons
              in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and
              photons have been proposed as quantum simulators. This review

              simulation and emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of
              this fast-growing field.",

              tessellation is used to generate moving computational meshes for
              the solution of multidimensional systems of conservation laws in
              finite-volume form. The mesh-generating points are free to move
              with arbitrary velocity, with the choice of zero velocity
              resulting in an Eulerian formulation. Moving the points at the
              local fluid velocity makes the formulation effectively
              Lagrangian. We have written the TESS code to solve the equations
              of compressible hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics for both
              relativistic and non-relativistic fluids on a dynamic Voronoi

              swarms can let the swarms cooperate in order to solve complex
              tasks. We focus on an indoor navigation task, in which we use a
              swarm of wheeled robots, called foot-bots, and a swarm of flying
              robots that can attach to the ceiling, called eye-bots. The task
              of the foot-bots is to move back and forth between a source and a
              target location. The role of the eye-bots is to guide foot-bots:
              they choose positions at the ceiling and from there give local
              directional instructions to foot-bots passing by. To obtain
              efficient paths for foot-bot navigation, eye-bots need on the one
              hand to choose good positions and on the other hand learn the
              right instructions to give.We investigate each of these aspects.
              Our solution is based on a process of mutual adaptation, in which
              foot-bots execute instructions given by eye-bots, and eye-bots
              observe the behavior of foot-bots to adapt their position and the

              wireless communications: by forwarding navigation infor- mation
              between them, robots cooperatively guide each other towards event
              locations. Such a collaborative approach leverages on the swarm’s
              intrinsic redundancy, distribution, and mobility. At the same
              time, the forwarding of navigation messages is the only form of
              coop- eration that is required. This means that the robots are
              free in terms of their movement and location, and they can be
              involved in other tasks, unrelated to the navigation of the
              searching robot. This gives the system a high level of
              flexibility in terms of application scenarios, and a high degree
              of robustness with respect to robot failures or unexpected
              events. We study the algorithm in two different scenarios, both
              in simulation and on real robots. In the first scenario, a single
              searching robot needs to find a single target, while all other
              robots are involved in tasks of their own. In the second
              scenario, we study collective navigation: all robots of the swarm
              navigate back and forth between two targets, which is a typical
              scenario in swarm robotics.We show that in this case, the
              proposed algorithm gives rise to synergies in robot navigation,
              and it lets the swarm self-organize into a robust dynamic
              structure. The emergence of this structure improves navigation
              efficiency and lets the swarm find shortest paths.",

              We impose certain conditions of fairness and convenience on such
              a mechanism and show that it admits unique prices, which equalize
              the value of offers and returns for each individual. We next
              define the complexity of a mechanism in terms of certain integers
              $\textbackslash{}tau_\{ij\},\textbackslash{}pi_\{ij\}$ and
              $k_\{i\}$ that represent the time required to exchange $i$ for
              $j$, the difficulty in determining the exchange ratio, and the
              dimension of the message space. We show that there are a finite
              number of minimally complex mechanisms, in each of which all
              trade is conducted through markets for commodity pairs. Finally

              investments in diffusible beneficial external products. While the
              costs of producing such products are born only by the producer,
              the benefits may be distributed more widely. How are external
              goods-producing populations stabilized against invasion by
              nonproducing variants that receive the benefits without paying
              the cost? This question parallels the classic question of
              altruism, but because external goods production need not be
              altruistic per se, a broader range of conditions may lead to the
              maintenance of these traits. We start from the physics of
              diffusion to develop an expression for the conditions that favor
              the production of diffusible external goods. Important variables
              in determining the evolutionary outcome include the diffusion
              coefficient of the good, the distance between individuals, and
              the uptake rate of the external good. These variables join the
              coefficient of relatedness and the cost/benefit ratio in an
              expanded form of Hamilton's rule that includes both selfish and
              altruistic paths to the evolution of external goods strategies.
              This expanded framework can be applied to any external goods
              trait, and is a useful heuristic even when it is difficult to

              (included with the distribution) Nature of problem: The LHC has
              delivered a wealth of new data that is now being analysed. Both
              ATLAS and CMS have performed many searches for new physics that
              theorists are eager to test their model against. However, tuning
              the detector simulations, understanding the particular analysis
              details and interpreting the results can be a tedious and
              repetitive task. Solution method: CheckMATE is a program package
              which accepts simulated event files in many formats for any
              model. The program then determines whether the model is excluded
              or not at 95\% C.L. by comparing to many recent experimental
              analyses. Furthermore the program can calculate confidence limits
              and provide detailed information about signal regions of
              interest. It is simple to use and the program structure allows
              for easy extensions to upcoming LHC results in the future.
              Restrictions: Only a subset of available experimental results
              have been implemented. Additional comments: Checkmate is built
              upon the tools and hard work of many people. If Checkmate is used
              in your publication it is extremely important that all of the
              following citations are included, •Delphes 3 [1].•FastJet [2,
              3].•Anti-kt jet algorithm [4].•CLs prescription [5].•In analyses
              that use the MT2 kinematical discriminant we use the Oxbridge

              the number of input events provided by the user. The detector
              simulation/analysis of 20000 events needs about 50 s/1 s for a

              quantify the effect of fluid acceleration on bed load transport
              in highly unsteady flows typical of nearshore marine
              environments. A simple impulse-momentum approach explains
              simulation results and forms the basis for adding an
              acceleration-related term to widely used energetics sediment
              transport formulae. Transport predicted by the acceleration term
              becomes increasingly significant as wave shape approaches the
              sawtooth profile characteristic of surf zone bores. Simulations
              integrate F = ma and a corresponding set of equations for the
              torques for each sphere. Normal and tangential forces between
              contacting particles are linear functions of the distance between
              sphere centers and the relative tangential displacement at the
              contact point, respectively; particle interactions are both
              inelastic and frictional. Pressure gradient forces generated by
              the passage of surface gravity waves drive fluid and particle
              motion in a stack of thin horizontal fluid layers that exchange
              momentum and exert fluid drag, added mass, and buoyancy forces on
              particles. Transport properties of the simulated granular-fluid
              assemblage are robust to large variations in material properties
              of the particles. Simulated transport rates agree with available
              experimental data for unsteady transport of coarse sands; the
              mode of bed load motion, dispersion of bed load particles, and
              particle segregation by size and density are qualitatively
              consistent with available particle-scale observations of bed load
              transport of natural particles.",

              insights regarding important events and responses to such events.
              Events are inherently temporal, evolving over time. Existing
              visual text anal- ysis systems have provided temporal views of
              changes based on topical themes extracted from text data. But few
              have associated topical themes with events that cause the
              changes. In this paper, we propose an interactive visual
              analytics system, LeadLine, to au- tomatically identify
              meaningful events in news and social media data and support
              exploration of the events. To characterize events, LeadLine
              integrates topic modeling, event detection, and named en- tity
              recognition techniques to automatically extract information re-
              garding the investigative 4 Ws: who, what, when, and where for
              each event. To further support analysis of the text corpora
              through events, LeadLine allows users to interactively examine
              meaning- ful events using the 4 Ws to develop an understanding of
              how and why. Through representing large-scale text corpora in the
              form of meaningful events, LeadLine provides a concise summary of
              the corpora. LeadLine also supports the construction of simple
              narra- tives through the exploration of events. To demonstrate
              the efficacy of LeadLine in identifying events and supporting

  abstract = "Stone is widespread in its use as a building material and
              artistic medium. One of its most remarkable qualities is that it
              changes ap- pearance as it interacts with the environment. These
              changes are mainly confined to the surface but involve complex
              volumetric ef- fects such as erosion and mineral dissolution.
              This paper presents an approach for the modeling and rendering of
              changes in the shape and appearance of stone. To represent stone,
              we introduce a slab data structure, which is a surface-aligned
              volume confined to a narrow region around the boundary of the
              stone. Our weathering model employs a simu- lation of the flow of
              moisture and the transport, dissolution, and recrystallization
              ofminerals within the porous stone volume. In ad- dition, this
              model governs the erosion of material from the surface. To render
              the optical effects of translucency and coloration due to the
              composition of minerals near the surface, we simulate the scat-
              tering of light inside the stone using a general subsurface Monte
              Carlo ray tracer. These techniques can capture many aspects of
              the time-dependent appearance of stone. We demonstrate the

              behavior in terms of a declarative process model rather than of a
              detailed procedural model. However, declarative models do not
              have an explicit notion of state, thus making it more difficult
              to pinpoint deviations and to explain and quantify discrepancies.
              This paper focuses on providing high-quality and understandable
              diagnostics. The notion of activation plays a key role in
              determining the effect of individual events on a given
              constraint. Using this notion, we are able to show
              cause-and-effect relations and measure the healthiness of the
              process.",

              why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and
              earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of
              readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in
              improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two
              sections of a science methods course (N=52) completed an
              open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts
              three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various
              instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three
              point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially
              had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way
              ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest)
              demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both

  abstract = "The field of interactive storytelling aims to create a narrative
              experience that is tailored to the player. A variety of
              Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been used to
              dynamically manage the narra- tive to suit the player’s
              preferences. Modern approaches tend to represent the domain of
              narrative discourse in a machine-readable form and then run
              automated planners to create a narrative that is consistent with
              the player’s choices as well as the author’s goals. The resulting
              planning task is frequently under-constrained and allows for many
              solutions. Since not every plan makes for an engaging story, the
              challenge lies with selecting one that will appeal to the
              particular player. In this paper, we conjecture that an engaging
              story is one that keeps the player in the psychological state of
              flow. Thus, an experience manager should select the narrative
              that is predicted to maximize the player’s state of flow. We
              propose to use a recent computational model of flow based on
              matching cognitive abilities of the audience with the cognitive
              demands of the narrative. The model will then be combined with a
              recent AI interactive narrative manager. This position paper is

  abstract = "All intelligence relies on search - for example, the search for
              an intelligent agent's next action. Search is only likely to
              succeed in resource-bounded agents if they have already been
              biased towards finding the right answer. In artificial agents,
              the primary source of bias is engineering. This dissertation
              describes an approach, Behavior-Oriented Design (BOD) for
              engineering complex agents. A complex agent is one that must
              arbitrate between potentially conflicting goals or behaviors.
              Behavior-oriented design builds on work in behavior-based and
              hybrid architectures for agents, and the object oriented approach
              to software engineering. The primary contributions of this
              dissertation are: 1. The BOD architecture: a modular architecture
              with each module providing specialized representations to
              facilitate learning. This includes one pre-specified module and
              representation for action selection or behavior arbitration. The
              specialized representation underlying BOD action selection is
              Parallel-rooted, Ordered, Slip-stack Hierarchical (POSH) reactive
              plans. 2. The BOD development process: an iterative process that
              alternately scales the agent's capabilities then optimizes the
              agent for simplicity, exploiting tradeoffs between the component
              representations. This ongoing process for controlling complexity
              not only provides bias for the behaving agent, but also
              facilitates its maintenance and extendibility.(cont.) The
              secondary contributions of this dissertation include two
              implementations of POSH action selection, a procedure for
              identifying useful idioms in agent architectures and using them
              to distribute knowledge across agent paradigms, several examples
              of applying BOD idioms to established architectures, an analysis
              and comparison of the attributes and design trends of a large
              number of agent architectures, a comparison of biological

  abstract = "Conceptual combination performs a fundamental role in creating
              the broad range of compound phrases utilized in everyday
              language. This article provides a novel probabilistic framework
              for assessing whether the semantics of conceptual combinations
              are compositional, and so can be considered as a function of the
              semantics of the constituent concepts, or not. While the
              systematicity and productivity of language provide a strong
              argument in favor of assuming compositionality, this very
              assumption is still regularly questioned in both cognitive
              science and philosophy. Additionally, the principle of semantic
              compositionality is underspecified, which means that notions of
              both ``strong'' and ``weak'' compositionality appear in the
              literature. Rather than adjudicating between different grades of
              compositionality, the framework presented here contributes formal
              methods for determining a clear dividing line between
              compositional and non-compositional semantics. In addition, we
              suggest that the distinction between these is contextually
              sensitive. Utilizing formal frameworks developed for analyzing
              composite systems in quantum theory, we present two methods that
              allow the semantics of conceptual combinations to be classified
              as ``compositional'' or ``non-compositional''. Compositionality
              is first formalised by factorising the joint probability
              distribution modeling the combination, where the terms in the
              factorisation correspond to individual concepts. This leads to
              the necessary and sufficient condition for the joint probability
              distribution to exist. A failure to meet this condition implies
              that the underlying concepts cannot be modeled in a single
              probability space when considering their combination, and the
              combination is thus deemed ``non-compositional''. The formal
              analysis methods are demonstrated by applying them to an
              empirical study of twenty-four non-lexicalised conceptual
              combinations.",

              which communicate by sending data over FIFO channels. In this
              paper we study the algebraic structure of the data flow networks
              and base their semantics on stream processing functions. Our
              algebraic theory is based on the calculus of flownomials. With an
              additive (or cantorian) interpretation the calculus gives a
              unified presentation of the classical algebraic models for
              control structures, that is, regular algebra and iteration
              theories. The kernel of the calculus is an equational
              axiomatization called basic network algebra (BNA) for flow graphs
              modulo graph isomorphism. We show that the algebra of stream
              processing functions called SPF (used for deterministic networks)
              and the algebra of sets of stream processing functions called
              PSPF (used for nondeterministic networks) are BNA algebras.
              Actually they give a multiplicative (or cartesian) interpretation
              of the calculus of flownomials. As a byproduct this shows that
              both semantic models are compositional. This means the semantics
              of a network may be described in terms of the semantics of its
              components. (As it is well known this is not true for the
              input--output relational semantics of nondeterministic networks.)
              We also identify additional axioms satisfied by the branching
              constants in these two algebraic theories. For the deterministic
              case we study in addition the coarser equivalence relation on

              services, require abstractions beyond those found in typical
              object-oriented programming languages. This paper explores
              service-oriented abstractions such as service adaptation,
              discovery, and querying in an object-oriented setting. We develop
              a formal model of dynamic object-oriented groups which offer
              services to their environment. These groups fit directly into the
              object-oriented paradigm in the sense that they can be
              dynamically created, they have an identity, and they can receive
              method calls. In contrast to objects, groups are not used for
              structuring code. A group exports its services through interfaces
              and relies on objects to implement these services. Objects may
              join or leave different groups. Groups may dynamically export new
              interfaces, they support service discovery, and they can be
              queried at runtime for the interfaces they support. We define an
              operational semantics and a static type system for this model of
              dynamic object groups, and show that well-typed programs do not

              algorithm that support view-dependent effects. First, we replace
              the 1D texture with a 2D texture whose second dimension
              corresponds to the desired ``tone detail,'' which can vary with
              depth or surface orientation. This supports effects such as
              levels-of-abstraction, aerial perspective, depth-of-field,
              backlighting, and specular highlights.Second, we further extend
              the toon shader to use a modified normal field that can range
              from the original normals to a simpler set of normals taken from
              an ``abstracted shape.'' A global shape detail parameter

  author   = "Barbieri, Marcello",
  abstract = "Biosemiotics is the idea that life is based on semiosis, i.e., on
              signs and codes. This idea has been strongly suggested by the
              discovery of the genetic code, but so far it has made little
              impact in the scientific world and is largely regarded as a
              philosophy rather than a science. The main reason for this is
              that modern biology assumes that signs and meanings do not exist
              at the molecular level, and that the genetic code was not
              followed by any other organic code for almost four billion years,
              which implies that it was an utterly isolated exception in the
              history of life. These ideas have effectively ruled out the
              existence of semiosis in the organic world, and yet there are
              experimental facts against all of them. If we look at the
              evidence of life without the preconditions of the present
              paradigm, we discover that semiosis is there, in every single
              cell, and that it has been there since the very beginning. This
              is what biosemiotics is really about. It is not a philosophy. It
              is a new scientific paradigm that is rigorously based on
              experimental facts. Biosemiotics claims that the genetic code (1)
              is a real code and (2) has been the first of a long series of
              organic codes that have shaped the history of life on our planet.
              The reality of the genetic code and the existence of other
              organic codes imply that life is based on two fundamental
              processes--copying and coding--and this in turn implies that
              evolution took place by two distinct mechanisms, i.e., by natural
              selection (based on copying) and by natural conventions (based on
              coding). It also implies that the copying of genes works on
              individual molecules, whereas the coding of proteins operates on
              collections of molecules, which means that different mechanisms
              of evolution exist at different levels of organization. This
              review intends to underline the scientific nature of
              biosemiotics, and to this purpose, it aims to prove (1) that the
              cell is a real semiotic system, (2) that the genetic code is a
              real code, (3) that evolution took place by natural selection and
              by natural conventions, and (4) that it was natural conventions,
              i.e., organic codes, that gave origin to the great novelties of
              macroevolution. Biological semiosis, in other words, is a
              scientific reality because the codes of life are experimental
              realities. The time has come, therefore, to acknowledge this fact
              of life, even if that means abandoning the present theoretical
              framework in favor of a more general one where biology and
              semiotics finally come together and become biosemiotics.",

              many organic codes in Nature, despite the fact that we can prove
              their existence. As a result, it has not yet accepted the idea
              that the great events of macroevolution were associated with the
              origin of new organic codes, despite the fact that this is the
              most parsimonious and logical explanation of those events. This
              is probably due to the fact that the existence of organic codes
              in all fundamental processes of life, and in all major
              transitions in the history of life, has enormous theoretical
              implications. It requires nothing less than a new theoretical
              framework, and that kind of change is inevitably slow. There are
              too many facts to reconsider, too many bits of history to weave
              together in a new mosaic. But this is what science is about, and
              the purpose of the present paper is to show that it can be done.
              More precisely, it is shown that the whole natural history of the
              brain can be revisited in the light of the organic codes. What is
              described here is only a bird’s-eye view of brain macroevolution,
              but it is hoped that the extraordinary potential of the organic
              codes can nevertheless come through. The paper contains also
              another message. The organic codes prove that life is based on
              semiosis, and are in fact the components of organic semiosis, the
              first and the most diffused form of semiosis on Earth, but not
              the only one. It will be shown that the evolution of the brain
              was accompanied by the development of two new types of sign
              processes. More precisely, it gave origin first to interpretive
              semiosis, mostly in vertebrates, and then to cultural semiosis,

              A considerable body of research shows that the lateral prefrontal
              cortex (PFC) is crucial for causal reasoning, but also that there
              are significant differences in the manner in which ventrolateral

              Recently, this motivational power has started to be applied to
              non- game contexts, a practice known as Gamification. This adds
              gaming elements to non-game processes, motivating users to adopt

              working more, or learning something new. This paper describes an

              paper begins with a theoretical articulation of transformational
              play. Students who play transformationally become protagonists
              who use the knowledge, skills, and concepts of the educational
              content to first make sense of a situation and then make choices
              that actually transform the play space and themselves---they are
              able to see how that space changed because of their own efforts.
              Grounding these theoretical ideas, in this manuscript we describe
              one curriculum design informed by this theory. We also describe a
              study of the same teacher who was observed teaching two different
              curricula (game-based versus story-based) about persuasive
              writing. Results showed that while students in both classes
              demonstrated significant learning gains, the gains were
              significantly greater for students in the game-based classroom.
              Additionally, students assigned the game-based unit reported
              significantly higher levels of engagement, had different goals
              motivating their participation, and received fewer teacher
              reprimands to stay on task. Both quantitative and qualitative
              results are interpreted in terms of the theory of
              transformational play, which guided the design. Implications in

              Contexts are often embedded in the application program or are

              regarding different levels/codes of analysis in language
              processing, attention, and memory. The lexical unit is ideally
              suited for such work because words can be analyzed at many
              different levels-for example, features, letters, graphemes,
              phonemes, morphemes, and semantics. Word recognition research is
              also central in the development of theories of automatic and
              attentional processes. Part of the reason for this emphasis is
              the natural relation between the development of reading skills
              and the development of automaticity. One can see the extra
              impetus from education circles regarding the development of word
              recognition skills. Moreover, the notion that the aspect of word
              recognition has been automatized and is no longer under the
              conscious control of the reader has historically provided some of
              the major fuel for arguments regarding self-encapsulated
              linguistic processing modules. The issue of how attentional
              control signals might modulate processes involved in word
              recognition has received renewed interest recently, and hence,
              notions of automaticity and modularity have been reevaluated.

              reachability analysis, i.e. proving or disproving that a given
              term is reachable from a set of input terms, provides an
              efficient verification technique. Using a tree automata
              completion technique, it has been shown that the non reachability
              of a term t can be verified by computing an over-approximation of
              the set of reachable terms and proving that t is not in the
              over-approximation. Since the verification of real programs gives
              rise to rewrite models of significant size, efficient
              implementations of completion are essential. We present in this
              paper a TRS transformation preserving the reachability analysis
              by tree automata completion. This transformation makes the
              completion implementation based on rewriting techniques possible.
              Thus, the reduction of a term to a state by a tree automaton is
              fully handled by rewriting. This approach has been prototyped in
              Tom, a language extension which adds rewriting primitives to

              characteristics of problem solving by focusing on the cues that
              arise within a solver's external environment. In examining the
              influence of external cues on problem solving we have been
              heavily influenced by Kirsh's (The Cambridge handbook of situated
              cognition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009) ``theory
              of hints''. We extend this theory to include hints that derive
              from the communicative properties of other people's eye
              movements, focusing on the role of eye gaze in directing
              attention and conveying information that can be beneficial for
              problem solving. A particularly interesting aspect of eye gaze is
              its capacity to facilitate the perceptual priming of motor
              simulations in an observer. This gives rise to the potential for
              an expert problem solver's eye movements to cue imitative
              perceptual and attentional processing in less expert observers
              that can promote effective problem solving. We review studies
              that support the hypothesised role of gaze cues in scaffolding
              problem solving, focusing on examples from insight tasks and
              diagnostic radiography. Findings reveal that eye gaze can support
              a variety of decisions and judgements in problem solving
              contexts. Iii sum, knowing where another person looks provides
              hints that can act both implicitly and explicitiy to cue
              attention and to shape thoughts and decisions. (PsycINFO Database

              multiple rounds of MapReduce. We introduce a distributed and
              generalized version of Yannakakis's algorithm, called GYM. GYM
              takes as input any generalized hypertree decomposition (GHD) of a
              query of width $w$ and depth $d$, and computes the query in
              $O(d)$ rounds and $O(n(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{IN\}^w +
              \textbackslash{}mathrm\{OUT\}))$ communication and computation
              cost. Using GYM we achieve two main results: (1) Every width-$w$
              query can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds of MapReduce with
              $O(n(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{IN\}^w +
              \textbackslash{}mathrm\{OUT\}))$ cost; (2) Every width-$w$ query
              can be computed in $O(\textbackslash{}log(n))$ rounds of
              MapReduce with $O(n(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{IN\}^\{3w\} +
              \textbackslash{}mathrm\{OUT\}))$ cost. We achieve our second
              result by showing how to construct a
              $O(\textbackslash{}log(n))$-depth and width-$3w$ GHD of a query
              of width $w$. We describe another general technique to construct
              even shorter depth GHDs with longer widths, effectively showing a
              spectrum of tradeoffs one can make between communication and
              computation and the number of rounds of MapReduce. By simulating
              MapReduce in the PRAM model, our second main result also implies
              the result of Gottlob et al.\textbackslash{}cite\{gottlob:acq\}
              that computing acyclic and constant-width queries are in NC. In
              fact, for certain queries, our approach yields significantly
              fewer PRAM steps than does the construction of the latter paper.
              However, we achieve our results using only Yannakakis's
              algorithm, which has been perceived to have a sequential nature.
              Instead, we surprisingly show that Yannakakis's algorithm can be
              parallelized significantly by giving it as input short-depth GHDs
              of queries.",

              However, both Intel and AMD have now introduced architectural

              built using geometric and topological conceptual space structures
              are well suited for semantic similarity and concept combination
              operations. In addition, concepts that are more closely grounded
              in the physical world, such as many spatial concepts, have a
              natural fit with the geometric structure of conceptual spaces.
              Despite these apparent advantages, conceptual spaces are
              underutilized because existing formalizations of conceptual space
              theory have focused on individual aspects of the theory rather

  abstract  = "CONTEXT\textbackslash{}nRequirements engineering is one of the
               most important and critical phases in the software development
               life cycle, and should be carefully performed to build high
               quality and reliable software. However, requirements are
               typically gathered through various sources and are represented
               in natural language (NL), making requirements engineering a
               difficult, fault prone, and a challenging task.
               \textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nOBJECTIVE\textbackslash{}nTo
               ensure high-quality software, we need effective requirements
               verification methods that can clearly handle and address
               inherently ambiguous nature of NL specifications. The objective
               of this paper is to propose a method that can address the
               challenges with NL requirements verification and to evaluate our
               proposed method through controlled experiments.
               \textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nMETHOD\textbackslash{}nWe
               propose a model-based requirements verification method, called
               NLtoSTD, which transforms NL requirements into a State
               Transition Diagram (STD) that can help to detect and to
               eliminate ambiguities and incompleteness. The paper describes
               the NLtoSTD method to detect requirement faults, thereby
               improving the quality of the requirements. To evaluate the
               NLtoSTD method, we conducted two controlled experiments at North
               Dakota State University in which the participants employed the
               NLtoSTD method and a traditional fault checklist during the
               inspection of requirement documents to identify the ambiguities
               and incompleteness of the requirements.
               \textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nRESULTS\textbackslash{}nTwo
               experiment results show that the NLtoSTD method can be more
               effective in exposing the missing functionality and, in some
               cases, more ambiguous information than the fault-checklist
               method. Our experiments also revealed areas of improvement that
               benefit the method’s applicability in the future.
               \textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSION\textbackslash{}nWe
               presented a new approach, NLtoSTD, to verify requirements
               documents and two controlled experiments assessing our approach.
               The results are promising and have motivated the refinement of
               the NLtoSTD method and future empirical evaluation.",

              workflow management systems, so far with little convergence of
              definitions or models. Provenance in databases has generally been
              defined for relational or complex object data, by propagating
              fine-grained annotations or algebraic expressions from the input
              to the output. This kind of provenance has been found useful in
              other areas of computer science: annotation databases,
              probabilistic databases, schema and data integration, etc. In
              contrast, workflow provenance aims to capture a complete
              description of evaluation - or enactment - of a workflow, and
              this is crucial to verification in scientific computation.
              Workflows and their provenance are often presented using
              graphical notation, making them easy to visualize but
              complicating the formal semantics that relates their run-time
              behavior with their provenance records. We bridge this gap by
              extending a previously-developed dataflow language which supports
              both database-style querying and workflow-style batch processing
              steps to produce a workflow-style provenance graph that can be
              explicitly queried. We define and describe the model through
              examples, present queries that extract other forms of provenance,
              and give an executable definition of the graph semantics of

              gained remarkable ground from academia and industry. CMA is the
              state-of-the-art mobile augmentation model that employs
              resource-rich clouds to increase, enhance, and optimize computing
              capabilities of mobile devices aiming at execution of
              resource-intensive mobile applications. Augmented mobile devices
              envision to perform extensive computations and to store big data
              beyond their intrinsic capabilities with least footprint and
              vulnerability. Researchers utilize varied cloud-based computing
              resources (e.g., distant clouds and nearby mobile nodes) to meet
              various computing requirements of mobile users. However,
              employing cloud-based computing resources is not a
              straightforward panacea. Comprehending critical factors that
              impact on augmentation process and optimum selection of
              cloud-based resource types are some challenges that hinder CMA
              adaptability. This paper comprehensively surveys the mobile
              augmentation domain and presents taxonomy of CMA approaches. The
              objectives of this study is to highlight the effects of remote
              resources on the quality and reliability of augmentation
              processes and discuss the challenges and opportunities of
              employing varied cloud-based resources in augmenting mobile

              taxonomy of augmentation types, including traditional and
              cloud-based. We critically analyze the state-of-the-art CMA
              approaches and classify them into four groups of distant fixed,
              proximate fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid to present a
              taxonomy. Vital decision making and performance limitation
              factors that influence on the adoption of CMA approaches are
              introduced and an exemplary decision making flowchart for future
              CMA approaches are presented. Impacts of CMA approaches on mobile

              algorithmic advances in join processing to com- pile patterns
              into Boolean algebra operations that exploit SIMD parallelism.
              The EmptyHeaded engine demonstrates that treating graph patterns
              as a general join processing problem can compete with and often
              outperform both spe- cialized approaches and existing OLAP
              systems on graph queries. The core Boolean algebra operation
              performed in EmptyHeaded is set intersection. Extracting SIMD
              paral- lelism during set intersections on graph data is
              challenging because graph data can be skewed in several different
              ways. Our contributions are a demonstration of this new type of
              engine with Boolean algebra at its core, an exploration of set
              intersection representations and algorithms for set in-
              tersections that are optimized for skew. We demonstrate that
              EmptyHeaded outperforms specialized graph engines by over an
              order of magnitude and relational systems by over two orders of
              magnitude. Our results suggest that this new style of engine is a
              promising new direction for future graph engines and

                 nanowires for electronic applications. Here, we demonstrate
                 wafer-scale assembly of highly ordered, dense, and regular
                 arrays of NWs with high uniformity and reproducibility through
                 a simple contact printing process. The assembled NW pitch is
                 shown to be readily modulated through the surface chemical
                 treatment of the receiver substrate, with the highest density
                 approaching approximately 8 NW/mum, approximately 95\%
                 directional alignment, and wafer-scale uniformity. Such fine
                 control in the assembly is attained by applying a lubricant

  abstract    = "Ever since its discovery, graphene bears great expectations in
                 high frequency electronics due to its irreplaceably high
                 carrier mobility. However, it has long been blamed for the
                 weakness in generating gains, which seriously limits its pace
                 of development. Distributed amplification, on the other hand,
                 has successfully been used in conventional semiconductors to
                 increase the amplifiers' gain-bandwidth product. In this
                 paper, distributed amplification is first applied to graphene.
                 Transmission lines phase-synchronize paralleled graphene
                 field-effect transistors (GFETs), combining the gain of each
                 stage in an additive manner. Simulations were based on
                 fabricated GFETs whose fT ranged from 8.5 GHz to 10.5 GHz and
                 fmax from 12 GHz to 14 GHz. A simulated four-stage graphene
                 distributed amplifier achieved up to 4 dB gain and 3.5 GHz
                 bandwidth, which could be realized with future IC processes. A
                 PCB level graphene distributed amplifier was fabricated as a
                 proof of circuit concept.",

  abstract    = "In the last couple of decades, the spatial resolution in
                 optical microscopy has increased to unprecedented levels by
                 exploiting the fluorescence properties of the probe. At about
                 the same time, Raman imaging techniques have emerged as a way
                 to image inherent chemical information in a sample without
                 using fluorescent probes. However, in many applications, the
                 achievable resolution is limited to about half the wavelength
                 of excitation light. Here we report the use of structured
                 illumination to increase the spatial resolution of label-free
                 spontaneous Raman microscopy, generating highly detailed
                 spatial contrast from the ensemble of molecular information in
                 the sample. Using structured line illumination in
                 slit-scanning Raman microscopy, we demonstrate a marked
                 improvement in spatial resolution and show the applicability
                 to a range of samples, including both biological and inorganic
                 chemical component mapping. This technique is expected to
                 contribute towards greater understanding of chemical component
                 distributions in organic and inorganic materials.",
