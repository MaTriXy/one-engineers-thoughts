// A simple struct to represent (write) effects. A write is represented as a
// modification of type bounds (e.g. of a variable).
//
// An effect can either be definite, if the write is known to have taken place,
// or 'possible', if it was optional. The difference is relevant when composing
// effects.
//
// There are two ways to compose effects: sequentially (they happen one after
// the other) or alternatively (either one or the other happens). A definite
// effect cancels out any previous effect upon sequencing. A possible effect
// merges into a previous effect, i.e., type bounds are merged. Alternative
// composition always merges bounds. It yields a possible effect if at least
// one was only possible.
