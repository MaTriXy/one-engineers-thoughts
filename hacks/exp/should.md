This is coffee/js test pattern, but strings.
Really the "should" should be a part of the specification itself

```
it 'displays errors for missing documentation', ->
```

This really is a temporal logic specification using modal `should`:

```
it should display errors
  do the errors.
```

It's defining the desired state _when the test/action is executed_. Rather than having to define in present tense, `it displays errors`
