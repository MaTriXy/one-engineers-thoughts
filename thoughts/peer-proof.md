Since we assume the present of at least one peer, we automatically get the meet.

```coffee
fact meet, from peer
  because one # justification / fact tree
```

justification of fact
reasoning
proof of fact
tree of fact
"fact tree"

(me iterating / narrowing down the definition until it _suits_ or _fits_ the _facts_).

"Definition" is the "meaning" or "feel" or "mean"? Maybe _mean_ == _feel_? No the _mean_ is the feel of a meet of selfs. It is a term in a code? So because of the _feel_ of the _term_ "peer" from the _sage_ _view_!

```coffee
fact meet, from peer
  from feel,
    of term peer
    from sage view
```

This is the structure of a _proof_ in this system! YAY! That is how it should be.
