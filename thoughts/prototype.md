sketch -> wireframe -> mockup
diagram -> prototype -> implementation

wireframe
  black and white
  still figuring out structure

prototype
  collection of wireframes
  so you can feel the flow
  navigation
  since it's wireframes, it's still black and white

mockup
  high quality visuals
  builds on wireframe
  introduces color
  I like separating them, spending time on visuals takes time. So youâ€™d end up polishing something that was wrong in the first place.

When building mockups, you already have a lot of customer research ideally. So by this point, you hopefully have some dummy data as well, to use in your mockups. Some real-world examples.

Wireframes: skeleton/structure
Mockups: skin/visual aspect
