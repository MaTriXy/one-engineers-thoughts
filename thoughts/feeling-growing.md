I am starting to be able to see there are places I can improve. I owe that to segment, who has taught me how to see when I can improve more. I am surrounded by people who are all pushing themselves to grow and become positive. I am starting to no longer feeling attacked when given negative feedback. I am instead capturing it like data, which I can use to improve how I interact.

I used to feel attacked when given negative feedback, because it sounded like an attack against me. It sounded like if I did something wrong I was "bad". And I didn't like to feel I was bad, so I would not listen to the feedback, and instead try to justify my reasoning.

This got me to be very good at reasoning haha. But it meant I wasn't able to reason about myself very well.

Now I feel like I am learning to reason about myself better, and be able to take feedback "constructively", to use it to construct a better reality.

The goal is to be able to remember your priorities at all times. Be able to quickly see what you prioritize. Have a lookup table for it. So when you are deep in the middle of something hard, you don't give into the feeling of doing something else that you feel would be more pleasing. Instead, you know you have already decided in advance that you would be more pleased to do something else. So you should just focus on doing that thing.

This is how you can move projects along quickly. Every day remind yourself of your priorities. Think over how they will feel. **Refresh your motivation.**

For humans to be effective, we need to refresh motivation quickly, using a preplanned map of activity. We have already solved the problems in advance, and now are learning and creating value for others in real time, in the moment. In the now.

definition now
  The current state.

pattern now
  pattern state current

record now
  field bits, pattern sequence bit

term now

(That is how you can write the math paper haha)

That is a note in model natural language: (foo), in parentheses at the start of a line. In model formal language, it's different.

But you have to divide your time up. Sometimes think of the priorities, other times think of learning a new skill, other times think of being social. You can't do all of them together. So you have to learn to transition in and out of them effectively. So you don't have to feel pain or embarrasment, yet other's still respect you. Once you can do that, then you can start working on your own ideas.
