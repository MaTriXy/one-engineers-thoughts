We would say "as long as you can survive on less than $2k/month, we'll support you building your thing, as long as you contribute back good quality to our main goal." Then people can be creative, and live in a house of 6 for a while, and just hack on cool stuff, while giving back to the common good. The main goal would be to build cheap, sustainable housing, but we could have other lofty goals tool. Then we pay them for like 7hours/month, but then because they have the time, they can learn anything they want.

This is the first step in moving toward a nearly-zero marginal cost society. If we can focus more of our time on really important problems, then we can we can solve the problems like 3d printing food and housing faster, where we'll have total freedom from physical tasks.

We can also have more time to be rational, to think about where the universe will go. We won't have to think about money as much.

The one condition: You live a good life. By "good", we mean you're contributing to the problem solving system, improving the state of the world by some measurable and semi-predictable amount. If you're not doing good, we will have to enter in another phaze of dealing with you somehow.

Because you contribute to the greater good above some metric, you get money to survive and thrive. That really is the purpose of working today. But in this new measurable way, you wouldn't have to work at a place. You just need to contribute to the greater good, now that you can with code and 3d printing.

So then the main metric used to measure is, how do we define the "greater good"? How do we distinguish good vs. bad behaviors automatically? Once we can do that, and measure it, then we can ask everyone to contribute to this. And that is how they get "paid", they get resources to survive and thrive as long as they contribute some of their time to increasing the goodness and intelligence of the universe.
