## Problem of seeing the whole picture of product development (sales)

- sales needs an overview of the state of the integrations so they can talk knowledgeably about the whole product
- how can you put a diagnosis on when this thing can be fixed?
- sales needs a presentation/deck (5% of the time) to show how the product works
  - problem: explaining how the product works in simple visualizations

## Problem of explaining/selling the product (team members, sales)

- explain what the product does
- how to think about the product
- the use cases
- how to set customer expectations?
  - what are customer expectations?
- identify common misconceptions customers have of the product
  - they think we collect the data from all one place
  - how do you understand what the customer understands?
- identify the main value it offers customers
  - enable tools without being able to do any more work
  - enable customers to build tools on top of data stream

Need to have a clear picture of the problems the product solves. The customer problems. Need to teach prospect/customer about the product in as simple a way as possible (messaging).

How can you know what's a misconception when the product hasn't yet been clearly explained?

## Problem of gleaning insights (collecting data) from customers through interviews

- which questions do you ask?
  - identify which questions you should ask, to get the most data
    - identify the lack of knowledge you have (sets up the base problem)
- how do tell which answers are good
- what data are you trying to collect?
- customers only see what's on the front
  - they are encountering small problems here and there
  - under the hood we have spent 6 months doing new things

some insights:

- customers ask out through issues a lot to ask "what do you guys do", get a better explanation
- why don't people understand us?
- target audience quickly grasps what we do
  - outside people don't get it
  - high growth startups (people who actively do their own research)

## Problem of understanding the customer problems/jobs

## Thoughts

- Break customers into segments/audiences, purely to simplify explanation
  - sales tailors explanation to each person
- audiences have jargon and common/shared knowledge, and problems to solve
  - so we should group the different jargons
  - so audiences have a set of knowledge and problems shared
  - so generally, an explanation should be tailored to knowledge and problems per person, but a shortcut can be taken by focusing on audiences.
