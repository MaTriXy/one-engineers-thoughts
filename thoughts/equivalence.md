- Prove equivalence between graph model and sql model
  - define schema in sql
  - define graph schema
  - define pattern mapping them together
  - have generic "equivalence test" to see if the two can be derived from each other based on the pattern you defined
    - are they isomorphic?
    - are they complete representations of each other?
    - if not, it would hint at what else needs to be defined
    - what does it mean that they are equivalent? they can accept the same queries? (similar to automata)
    - Two schema are equivalent if they accept the exact same queries.
    - Two schemas are perfectly similar (or completely overlap) if they accept the exact same queries, but also accept their own queries that the other one doesn't accept.
- Given that you can do that, then derive an equivalent sql model from a graph schema
- Prove equivalence between graph model and rest api
