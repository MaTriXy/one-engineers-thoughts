The setup flow is a way of discretely breaking up steps so that:

- the are easy to do
- the user completes all of them
- they feel like they understand what's happening
- they feel in control

To do this, you have to somehow divide them into different activities.

You want to order the steps, first giving them information so they know what they are getting, before asking that they fill out any information. So don't have them fill out a form before they can select the stuff they want to get.

We just have this innate desire to want to hold/see/pickout stuff. So you have to choose what kind of service you want first, sometimes. But you don't want too many choices. The art of presenting choices.

Admin tasks to getting what you want. We would ideally not want to do these "admin tasks", and just do the other task. Why don't we like those tasks?

> probably why HDMI cables are better than component cables, it’s quicker

What tasks do we find unpleasant, vs. pleasant.
