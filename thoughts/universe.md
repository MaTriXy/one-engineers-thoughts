Instead of "spacetime", it's more of a "state space". At speed of light, there can be no state changes (time stands still). Below the speed of light, there can be many state changes.

At the extreme of gravity, like a black whole, time also would "freeze" (http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/29082/would-time-freeze-if-you-could-travel-at-the-speed-of-light), so there can be no state changes.

So these set the bounds between which state changes can occur.

From your frame of reference, everything seems normal. But someone moving faster than you, you see their time as moving slower. So the faster you are, the less state changes you appear to have.
