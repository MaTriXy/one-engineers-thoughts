## core game loop

Maybe games/apps should have their core game loop. The thing the that brings the user back to churn away.

This is easy to learn and motivating. In resident evil, it's the fact that you can explore. In mario, it's exploring and playing levels. In facebook, it's going to your feed. In instagram, same.

Then the "admin" section is like the menu in games. It's tangential to this core game loop, but where all the data is stored. So for facebook, it's like your settings. For mario, it's the controls.

For a B2B app, it's like the management of the data. Once the data is managed, it should be out of the way so you can play the game. If the game is mostly just configuring and then you're done, then maybe you have to invent a game loop that keeps them coming back.
