Aspects of good communication.

Transition is very important. Pay attention to the transition.

The transition frame must be evoked when you realize the other person is frustrated, yet they don't respond to logic.

The ideal for them would be to stop getting frustrated, and to explain their thoughts, and to desire to work well with the other person (customer), like you are a team mapping out the problem space.

This is ideal, but it is completely rational.

If the other person is capable of being rational on the fly (i.e. self inspecting their behavior, they realize they need to stop being emotional and to engage in logical analysis), then you can just point it out to them, "hey can we just map out what's not working between us?" That is most effective, because it is a problem that can be solved logically rather than emotionally, where things are still left unclear.

If the other person can't just introspect and overcome their current emotion, then you cannot tell them "let's be rational". That will just make them more emotional. They will interpret that as you saying they are stupid.

So then, why are they not paying attention to logic? They are not capable of overcoming their emotion, or are purposefully commited to not being logical with you, like a sworn enemy that will fight until the death.

But if you ask them, why are you still emotional, they will say "no i'm not, let's have a rational conversation." But this is still not true. They are not aware that you cannot be both frustrated and rational. It _seems_ like you can, but you cannot, the research shows this.

So don't go there with them.

Instead, you must focus on the _transition_. Either, you can let them be the way that they are, and don't spend too much effort on getting them to understand. So you just be friendly but avoid that desire with them.

But what are you supposed to do with your life partner, or your children? You can also do the same with them. You can either put in the effort to transfer to them your knowledge, or you can let them not gain your knowledge.

But that brings up the question, what do you do when you see a solution to somebody's problem, but they don't see it, and yet don't even know to ask?

I think I decided a while ago, you always have to let them come to the understanding (at least the ones that can't engage in pure logical reasoning, without bringing too much emotion that the logic falls apart).

This means, they need to discover on their own the possibility of a different world from their own. Maybe this comes when they see a documentary, or they overhear a friend mention something. All of these have no _motive_ that is related to the current self. So then it feels like they discovered a connection on how to improve their life. Other examples are seeing a friend make some food you like, so you learn a new recipe. Or researching for your wedding because you want everything to be nice like you've seen it for others in the past.

So then they realize, hey I may have this problem. But they may also not realize that. They may see the message over and over, but it doesn't _resonate_. It doesn't _match with their core experience_.

So then they don't gain the knowledge.

And you probably are watching this happen and are like "oh my god, don't you see, it's so clear!"

But that will just make them mad, because now you are telling them they are stupid (they experience). They hear "I'm stupid". And then they get defensive.

Then you think, well if they didn't get defensive, I could just share with them my knowledge and we would both benefit.

But by this point, they don't want your benefit. They will learn it on their own if it's necessary for them.

It's only necessary, once they learn on their own that they need to be self aware of when they are logical and emotional. Because once they are, then they can have _control of themselves_. Otherwise, they in a sense don't have full control of themselves.

If you know there are certain times when you can't control yourself, that is still okay. Because you are aware when you are not at your best. But if you are not aware that you can't control yourself at times, then this is where you need to somehow realize this.

This question is, how do you get people to realize this?

By asking them questions perhaps. The socratic method. But something just for fun, nothing directly about them.

Only until they realize fully that they are in control and fully capable, then can you start directly asking them to be logical with you at certain times, and then you can stay logical with each other and be effective and be getting better.

Yeah, how do you get people to realize they have control of their lives, and to become aware of the times they are not in control of their lives?

Some people don't want to improve, because they have never experienced the problem, and because it doesn't seem like it would be valuable. So you can't just say "hey want to learn x with me?" and have them ask more questions. They wont. Most people don't. Very few do, like 1 out of 10,000 I would say, at least in bay area, based on my personal life.

Instead it has to be more subtle. Below consciousness. It has to "arise naturally". So in the course of events, it needs to become relevant. So what you do is start living a life where you will run into those problems. And then let them learn on their own, and if they ask questions, give them answers, otherwise just support their experience, and bring them along.

So _leaders_ are the ones who love to ask questions. They are the ones who _want_ to solve new problems. There are very few leaders.

Most people are _followers_. But that's a bad word, unless like used in Twitter. So basically, you are the one who is exploring a new territory, and your followers are the ones who are coming along, to be with you, and maybe to gain some of the benefits that you have opened up. But they aren't thinking "oh this is a great chance for me to learn how to climb a mountain, or x". That is what a leader would think. A chance to improve themself. Instead, the followers look at it as, I will learn what I need to learn, otherwise I just want to "have a good time".

When they come along with a leader exploring a new territory, the followers will inevitably encounter new problems. You can't directly give them their knowledge, unless they have been raised with the principles like the Stoics, that we can control ourselves, but not others. So, don't get angry. Learn from others by asking questions, rather than trial and error. Be efficient, and do good. Improve yourself and the world.

If they don't believe those principles, then they have to discover it on their own.

Therefore, it is a problem of how to instill principles into human beings. All humans must realize that they are capable, that they should be confident like everyone else. That they may have a disadvantage, but that there are good people out there willing to help. And eventually if you don't keep yourself down, you can do pretty much anything you can imagine.

So basically it is a distinction between the ones who:

- practice self awareness
- don't practice self awareness

Until you start actively practicing self awareness, you are not fully self aware.

But you can't tell people this :). That is insulting to someone who is not totally self aware.

Instead, they must discover this on their own.

They have to somehow discover it on their own. But sometimes they just don't want to hear it. So what do you do?
