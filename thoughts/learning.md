Asking questions to guide someone to your conclusion is the best approach for two reasons:

1. It means they solve the problems themselves. This is inherently enjoyable (built into the brain to experience pleasure from this).
2. It means they either come to your conclusion or a different conclusion. If they come to a different conclusions, it means they found a better way than you even had, which is a good thing (you can adopt that conclusion too). If they don't find a better one, than you were correct.

You can't tell people conclusions, they must reach the conclusions on their own.

However, that's not the best way for them to learn (though it seems most common). The best way to learn is to assume the conclusions are correct (or at least, there is a lot of validity to them), and to try and retrace their steps. This way you can benefit from others work and don't have to slowly recreate the wheel.

Not sure if you can teach people how to accept conclusions as correct later in their life. Maybe it has to be taught when they're young. How to demonstrate this?
