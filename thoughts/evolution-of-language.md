A language maybe evolves b/c:

1. peers in an environment/space/meet have certain sounds _around_ them, like birds, streams, etc.
2. they must make their sounds _fit_ into the environment. so they have to _make sense_ to anyone in that environment.
3. with basic sounds in place, you can then modify those sounds and extend them in _whatever way feels good_, or makes sense. some word combinations _dont feel good_
4. so it's like an _evolving feel good make word game_.

A _doll_ is a _hand made representation_. A _representation_ is a _note_?

Language is _definitely_ a cultural deal in some way. A _meet deal_. It helps create a _mesh_. It must be _agreed upon_ by _each peer with vote_.

- vote
- deal
- purr
- buzz
- face/back
- rime (rhyme)
- tact: able to effectively make decisions
- psst
- oops
- ahem
- ouch
- damn

## `back`

A _back_ is a _side_ you dont _see_.

A _back_ is the _face else_.

```
make back, from else face
```

> Pidgins are significantly simplified languages with only rudimentary grammar and a restricted vocabulary. In their early stage pidgins mainly consist of nouns, verbs, and adjectives with few or no articles, prepositions, conjunctions or auxiliary verbs. Often the grammar has no fixed word order and the words have no inflection.[106]

none -> pidgin -> creole -> primary

> A creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children â€” a process known as nativization.[2] The pidgin-creole life cycle was studied by Hall in the 1960s.[3]

> Building up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that "the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars", claiming that every noncreole language's grammar is at least as complex as any creole language's grammar.
