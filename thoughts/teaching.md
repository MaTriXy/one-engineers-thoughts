You have to explain:

- current state of the world
- the limitations/problems of the current state.
- then paint a potential picture

Here is the way we save the data. Some of the problems are:

- specific problems
  - (end result) we don't have a structure to what we're sending. this is the problem, but this is the general problem. The specific problem is what should be described, which is something I can't easily pinpoint.
    - The way we send data is slow.
    - It's error prone.
