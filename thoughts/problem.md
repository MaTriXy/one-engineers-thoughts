The origin of intelligence by problem solving. A book on intelligence theory.

A product solves a set of problems. So given a product/tool:

```coffee
find all problems it solves
  create situations and desired states based on experience or something
for problem, in problems
  demonstrate how to solve problem with examples
```

If the brain is a problem solving machine, then it remembers all problems. It's beliefs (knowledge) are about the problems they've solved. And so what is _simple_ to each brain is purely dependent on the problems they have solved. This is why a common education system is good, because then we have all solved largely similar problems. It's also why we should have freedom to explore different things, so we have different problems we've solved, so we can share.

All intentional actions are solutions to problems? If that turns out to be true, then that would mean that all conversation is solutions to problems. Then the question is, what are the problems that conversation is solving?

When I am in a conversation with a group, it's like I feel like I need to _contribute_ to the conversation. That is the solution so that you put resources in like everyone else, so they know you're going to help out. But if you take over the conversation, then it's like you don't let anyone do anything and control too much. So somehow conversations are about solving problems.


- maybe can have multiple "thought threads", even though it's all in sequence.
- since thoughts are mental actions, and actions are to solve problems, these are
- problem solving threads
- so we need to understand how problem solving threads are encoded.
- a project is a problem solving thread.

So problem solving threads are how humans are able to divide and conquer multiple problems at the same time.

These "problem solving threads" are dubbed "projects". So the problem, is how do you define projects?

Projects are commitments to solve problems, to get to a deliverable. So what is a commitment? And how do you group the problems?

A deliverable is a noticeable change in the state of the universe related to the problem space.

So intelligent agents are able to organize and solve multiple projects at once because they divide them into projects.

Projects can be nested.

Mini projects are called "tasks". When they can be done in under a day or so, it's considered a task it seems like.

So in reality then, tasks and projects are equivalent. They are both commitments to solve problems.

So you can think of a human being not being good at "multi tasking". This means we must do one task at a time.

Robots can do the same then, do one project or task at a time. I guess that's the difference between tasks and projects, you can be doing multiple projects at a time, but not multiple tasks. But ideally actually, you still want to be doing one project.

Anything else that gets added to the list of todos while they're working on the project gets "backlogged". It gets queued up. So any command that gets executed in the middle of some walkthrough, gets backlogged until the walkthrough is done, and we have confirmed our results.

Then it asks us if we want to continue with the next walkthroughs. But maybe we don't by now, so we can cancel. So each is an independent project so to speak.

If you save the same walkthrough again, it will override so you can more quickly iterate.
