An algorithm is a proof of a transformation?!

A proof of a type is the fact that you wrote it down.

So from those elements, you build up an evolvable transformation graph, a tropon, and the entire thing is proven.

Curry-howard correspondence: proofs == programs.

Since programs are sets of instructions, and algorithms are sets of instructions, then algorithms are proofs too.

A proof is a set of instructions transforming one thing into another.

An algorithm with no instructions is an identify function, or maybe with just the return instruction.
