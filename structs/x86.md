AX –The accumulator register BX –The base address register CX –The count register
DX –The data register

if you want to add the value five to the AX register, the CPU:
• Copies the value from AX into the ALU,
• Sends the value five to the ALU,
• Instructs the ALU to add these two values together,
• Moves the result back into the AX register.

example mov ax, [1000]
  desc Load `ax` with value stored in memory starting at location 1000hex
  is direct addressing mode

example mov ax, [bx]
  desc Load `ax` with the value stored in memory where `bx` points (bx's value is a memory address)

equal
  a
    mov bx, 1000
    mov ax, [bx]
  b
    mov ax, [1000]

example mov ax, [1000+bx]
  is indexed addressing mode
  desc This instruction is useful for accessing elements of arrays, records, and other data structures.

```asm
section .text
dec2hex:
  mov bl, al
  and al, 0Fh
  shr bl, 4
  mov esi, offset hextable
  and ebx, 0Fh
  mov cl, ds:[esi+ebx]
  mov ebx, esi
  xlatb

section .data
hextable db "0123456789ABCDEF"
```
