divide in:

- 5

- 3
- 2
- 1 (self loop)

Each has a different meaning. The pairs are the 2-player games it seems. Lone, true, tree, four, five, sync, heap, wait (after your current week).

```

7 + 5 for look into future before you have finished creating your plan. That is to say, you can't look more than 1 week ahead, since things will change.

One, two, three, four, five, six, hepta, eight.
