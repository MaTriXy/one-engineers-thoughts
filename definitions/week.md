> The Jews also adopted a seven-day cycle, based on the time it took the Lord to create the universe as reported in Genesis. A new wrinkle in their week was the Sabbath, a day set aside for rest. This was the first time a culture had invented a holiday that occurred on a regular basis, unrelated to natural phenomena.

> It's most likely that the origin is far more primitive than folks are suggesting in here.  The menstrual cycles of many different animals line up with the lunar cycle, and 7 days is about the time it takes to visually see the moon go from its first showing to a quarter full and similarly to each subsequent quarter fraction of fullness. 

> In the west, the tradition is an offshoot of the dominance of the big three religions (Judaism/Christianity/Islam) who inherited it from the Babylonians who set their holy days every seven days.

Every 7 day is a holy day. This is 1/4 rotation of moon. So moon cycle is 4 phases of 7 days. For each 4, there is a day dedicated to one of the solar bodies. The day of the moon, day of the sun, day of venus, etc... Why though?

> In Polish, the word for 'Sunday' is 'niedziela' which breaks down to 'nie' -> not 'dziela' working -- aka, the day of rest. There is some reason to believe that the 7 day cycle is based on the book of genesis and the time claimed for the creation of the earth.

So the week is based on the 7 days of creation.

(week experiment)

Why are the days given their names?

> Biblical months are based on the moon, and they begin at the first appearance of the visible crescent new moon. Our word month even derives from the word moon, moon(th). But a surprising doctrine is taking hold among a few contending that the weekly Sabbath is also set by the new moon each month. It teaches that the weekly Sabbath day floats all over the week.
http://www.yrm.org/lunarsabbath.htm

> The new moon is considered like a sabbath -- a day of no work. Every month begins with a new moon. The first work day is the second day of the count followed by 5 more work days.

>  second day of the count followed by 5 more work days. That gets you through the 7th day of the month (new moon  day plus 6 work days). The 8th day of the month is also the first weekly Sabbath of the month. Six more days of work gets you to the 15th as the next weekly Sabbath. Six more days of work and you come to the 3rd weekly Sabbath on the 22nd. Six more work days gets you to the 29th of the month, which is the last weekly Sabbath in the month. Then comes the next new moon, which is a not a work day but is a sabbath, but not a weekly Sabbath. Thus the weekly Sabbaths will always land on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, and 29th days of month. Some months will end with the weekly Sabbath on the 29th followed by the new moon  Sabbath the next day. More often, months will have an extra day or two between the last Sabbath and the next new moon day. Therefore you often have two or three Sabbaths or “non-work days” in a row before the new month begins.

> As we will show, the new moon is not a day of rest or a sabbath. In addition, the word week derives from a Hebrew word meaning “sevened” (sheb-u-wah).

> It is connected to a sequence of sevens, not to the new moon and not to more than seven. It begins with day one and ends with the seventh day, not the eighth day. Neither is “Sabbath” in any way linked 

> Genesis 1:14 is often cited to support a smorgasbord of calendar teachings, including a sunrise Sabbath doctrine and a solar-based, calculated calendar. Not to be left out, the lunar sabbatarians also seize on this Scripture as the preeminent proof for their doctrine. 

> When it comes to the Full Moon it gets really uncertain, with three or four consecutive moons every month all appearing full. Which one do you choose as the Sabbath moon? Note this from scientists: “Although Full Moon occurs each month at a specific date and time, the Moon's disk may appear to be full for several nights in a row if it is clear. This is because the percentage of the Moon's disk that appears illuminated changes very slowly around the time of Full Moon. The Moon may appear 100% illuminated only on the night closest to the time of exact Full Moon, but on the night before and night after will appear 97-99% illuminated; most people would not notice the difference. Even two days from Full Moon the Moon's disk is 93-97% illuminated” (quotation from U.S. Naval Observatory).

> Now be honest: does Yahweh establish His weekly Sabbath amid all this uncertainty and confusion? He is not the author of confusion, 1Corinthins 14:33. Are His people supposed to be aware of and distinguish among all the anomalies and similarities in lunar appearances when they keep the day of rest? Do we need college degrees in astronomy to observe the right Sabbath holy? Does that sound like the design of a wise Creator who gives plain and simple laws for us to keep? What about David out tending his flocks in the field, did he know all of this? Or did he just need to know how to count to seven for the proper time to observe the Sabbath? Frankly, the lunar Sabbath scheme appears like the shenanigans of mythical Greek deities trying to frustrate their human subjects just for the fun of it.

> The weekly Sabbath is a memorial to Yahweh’s creative act and His subsequent rest.

> The weekly Sabbath is a memorial to Yahweh’s creative act and His subsequent rest. He did not create high day Sabbaths by resting on them. To say the weekly Sabbath changes every month according to the cycles of the moon is to make the memorial to the creative rest of Yahweh into a memorial to the moon.

> Genesis 1 and 2 are crystal clear that Yahweh created the heavens and the earth in six days and then He rested on the seventh. Lunar sabbatarians ignore Yahweh’s rest on the seventh day and go solely with a Sabbath-setting lunar phase.

>  “Weeks” is the Hebrew shabua and literally means “sevened” not “lunared.” 

> Numbers 28:26 says the Feast of Firstfruits or Pentecost comes “after your weeks be out.” “Weeks” is the Hebrew shabua and literally means “sevened” not “lunared.” After your seven sevens are over and complete, then you observe the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost. The Bible, An American Translation by Goodspeed says, “…counting fifty days to the day following the seventh Sabbath, and then you shall present to Yahweh a grain-offering from the new crop.” The New English Bible says, “The day after the seventh Sabbath will make 50 days…”

> The Babylonian calendar was lunisolar with years consisting of 12 months. Counting from the new moon of every month, the Babylonians celebrated every seventh day as a "holy-day," also called an "evil day." On every seventh day offerings were made to a different deity. Merodach and Ishtar on the 7th, Nergal and Ninlil on the 14th, Shamash and Sin on the 21st, and Enki and Mah on the 28th. Tablets from the sixth-century BC reigns of Cyrus the Great and his son Cambyses give validity to these dates. The Babylonian calendar had a lunation of 29 or 30 days, containing three seven-day weeks, and a final week of nine or ten days which ended the continuous seven-day cycle. The remarkable similarities with the Babylonian calendar give us great insight into the origin of this doctrine and its error.

> Concordance says that "Babel" or "Babylon" means confusion through a mixing.

> Being idolators, the Babylonians perverted the true Sabbath Yahweh instituted at creation. Such perversion has continued throughout Biblical history. Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah and founder of Babylon, is one of the earliest examples. His perversions can still be seen today. In Genesis 10:10 we read the account of Nimrod: "And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar." Strong’s Concordance says that "Babel" or "Babylon" means confusion through a mixing. Ancient Babylon mixed truth with error, which is strongly condemned in the Word of Yahweh.

> Scripture warns us of Babylon’s influence "And upon her forehead was a name written, mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth," Revelation 17.

The "sabbath"

Day of no work.

So every multiple of 7 we stopped working. Decreasing the 7 process from 4 to 1 means faster turn around.

Babylonians had 7-day week.

Saturn day in rome was the sabbath. Rabbis called it "star of sabbath"
https://books.google.com/books?id=Kpfwhg1hE6QC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22moon+day%22+babylonian&source=bl&ots=wGfjYsAAZd&sig=wWFRYv8fpO0h8r-o6GiYCpWqdYA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG3v6N7q_KAhWFKGMKHXj0Av0Q6AEINDAE#v=onepage&q=%22moon%20day%22%20babylonian&f=false

Stoning or death to men who did work (collect wood) on the sabbath day.
- In 321 AD constantine made sun day holy day
  - magistrates, artisans, and city people, but not agricultural laborers, were to rest on the sun day

So Sunday is what separates modern life from ancient life. Living in the city versus in wild. Calm vs. wild mask.

Sun day as holy day is wild -> calm step.

Christianity toon Son and Sun to make church day. But Saturday was the original sabbath for the moon cycle.

Moon and luck?

Sunday is temporal center around which life moves. Monday is an image of time coming from eternity.

Drunk as nectar from moon's crescent cup. Every changing cycle of the moon.

Temple == templum == space cut off, "cut off and so sacred space of a god"
Temple == templum == space cut off, "cut off and so sacred space of good"

Thus, a place of worship is maybe wear ship, where good is shipped.

Lord is a law ford, a giving of law.

Notion of time as a cutting up "cut off". Moon is being cut out each frame.

We literally see moon being cut out like a slide show of 28 days.

Therefore, draw phases of moon.

Chronos is to "wear out" or "grind".

Zeus overthrew Time
Zeus is Jupiter, eagle, sky, roman army symbol, thunder.

> The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honoured him more than any other people had.

> Jupiter was "the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested."[8] He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours.[9]

Jupiter is like the self. The individual force. The king. The leader. The focus on the self. Self love.

> Patricians were historically afforded more privileges than plebeians.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrician_(ancient_Rome)

> In ancient Rome, the plebs was the general body of free Roman citizens who were not patricians, as determined by the census. From the 4th century BC or earlier, some of the most prominent and wealthy Roman families, as identified by their gens name, were of plebeian status (see Roman naming conventions).

So pleb and pater. Pleb and Pape/Pope. The Monk and the Mask. These were the two types of people. Out of choice, or ability.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plebs
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions

> Although conventionally referred to as the tria nomina, the combination of praenomen, nomen, and cognomen that have come to be regarded as the basic elements of the Roman name in fact represent a continuous process of development, from at least the seventh century BC to the end of the seventh century AD. The names developed as part of this system became a defining characteristic of Roman civilization, and although the system itself vanished during the early middle ages, the names themselves exerted a profound influence on the development of European naming practices, and many continue to survive in modern languages.

> Consisting of two distinct elements, or "themes," these names allowed for hundreds or even thousands of possible combinations

> In ancient Rome, a gens (/ˈɡɛns/ or /ˈdʒɛnz/), plural gentes, was a family, consisting of all those individuals who shared the same nomen and claimed descent from a common ancestor. A branch of a gens was called a stirps (plural stirpes). The gens was an important social structure at Rome and throughout Italy during the period of the Roman Republic. Much of an individual's social standing depended on the gens to which he belonged. Certain gentes were considered patrician, others plebeian, while some had both patrician and plebeian branches. The importance of membership in a gens declined considerably in imperial times.[1][2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gens

Gens is translated to race.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_Assembly

> During the years of the Roman Republic, citizens were organized on the basis of 35 tribes: 4 tribes (the "urban tribes") encompassed citizens inside the city of Rome, while the other 31 tribes (the "rural tribes") encompassed citizens outside the city. 

> Because the Romans used a form of direct democracy, citizens, and not elected representatives, voted before each assembly. As such, the citizen-electors had no power, other than the power to cast a vote. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_magistrate

> The Roman magistrates were elected officials in Ancient Rome. During the period of the Roman Kingdom, the King of Rome was the principal executive magistrate.[1] His power, in practice, was absolute. He was the chief priest, lawgiver, judge, and the sole commander of the army.[1][2] When the king died, his power reverted to the Roman Senate, which then chose an Interrex to facilitate the election of a new king.

King is the only decision maker. A king is the decision maker of a band. So kings make decisions. This is like the pointer in an associative computer process. A teacher, a boss, a leader, all kings. The decision makers.

Kings have absolute power.

> During the transition from monarchy to republic, the constitutional balance of power shifted from the executive (the Roman king) to the Roman Senate

But kings become corrupted easily. This is why they then switch to Senate.

>  Dictators had more "major powers" than any other magistrate, and after the Dictator was the censor, and then the consul, and then the praetor, and then the curule aedile, and then the quaestor.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dictator

> In the Roman Republic, the dictator was an "extraordinary magistrate" (magistratus extraordinarius) with the absolute authority to perform tasks beyond the authority of the ordinary magistrate (magistratus ordinarius).

> The office of dictator was a legal innovation originally named Magister Populi (Master of the People), i.e., Master of the Citizen Army.[2] The term was derived from dicto to dictate or prescribe.[3]

> The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC).

**in the first days of the city, the "founding days"**

7 days of creation?
