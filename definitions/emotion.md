definition emotion
  Non-conscious interpretation of information.

This way, it is _simpler_ evolutionarily. It is also powerful.

It is also _experiential_.

Bees feel emotion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_in_animals
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_emotion

Emotion like fear arrives once visual field is in place. So once the base signals are there, then emotion connects the sensory information to intelligent problem solving, such as recognizing a preditory pattern, and invoking a running response. So it is sort of simple pattern recognition used by the brain, to invoke physical behaviors. But it doesn't necessarily need to be intelligent/conscious. When exactly do intelligence and consciousness relate to emotion.

So emotion is how integrated information can translate into physical structure. Emotion is an algorithm that applies integrated information to physical structure.

Intelligent is once you can start doing what? How is it different from purely integrated information manipulating physical structure? Which is very useful since it is quick as a first step. The eager-loading of the page without any content. But then the text and design come through, and make a much more distinct piece. The emotions are the eager-loading, and intelligence is the actual content.

When does problem solving occur? When you can start sensing your sense system? Meta-cognition? When does this ability to sense your sense system come about? Do some mammals have this? Some animals that can learn. Or is this a conscious behavior? Intelligence occurs once you can start "consciously solving problems"? So do you have to be conscious to be intelligent?

outputs (analog signals) of hardwired mechanisms whose primary function is to
subserve the monitoring and updating of the central representational system of
humans,the belief-desire system

> Emotions occur in response to events, and make people more likely to respond to these
events with particular behaviors

>  Moreover, music perception potentially elicits emotions, thus giving
rise to the modulation of emotional effector systems such as the subjective feeling system,
the autonomic nervous system, the hormonal, and the immune system

Emotion is non-conscious interpretation of information.
