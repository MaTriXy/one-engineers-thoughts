> A scheduler is strongly fair if every process enabled infinitely often will run eventually.
> A scheduler is weakly fair if every process enabled persistently will run eventually.
> Given a transition graph, weak fairness ensures that the execution cannot remain forever in a state where there are enabled actions leading to other states.
> Under strong fairness no action can be enabled inﬁnitely often without being executed.
