definition strategy
  A strategy defines a set of moves or actions a player will follow in a given game.
```

in terms of genericness:

path > plan > strategy

> A Nash equilibrium, named after John Nash, is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to unilaterally change her action.
> Players are in equilibrium if a change in strategies by any one of them would lead that player to earn less than if she remained with her current strategy.
