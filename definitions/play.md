Why do children play?

Maybe they play because it's a natural way for them to learn about the world by rapidly gaining experience. You can also learn by being taught or by running into a problem that causes you pain.

In play, it's like you create problems for yourself to solve. "I want to zoom this car around the track", or "I want to see how high I can stack these legos". And that's inherently fun because learning is inherently enjoyable when it's something you want to do. You want to zoom the car around the track because you like throwing things or fast things, and you like seeing if you can do what you plan, as long as it's not too hard.

## Learning Environments

In play, you create problems for yourself to solve, to learn. In games, there are standard problems to solve. In teaching, the teacher creates problems for you to solve, which are only interesting if you yourself have that problem too. (School) Teachers can inspire you to feel the need for a solution to a problem, but it's hard. School makes you learn things to pass a test, but not to learn because they are interesting to you. Authorities (religions, parents, tyrants, etc.) force you to solve a problem in a way they like, you must learn their way, which is negative learning. You don't have the problem, and you don't understand the reason for the solution. Researching is like play (Researching is like Exploring), because you created your own problem and are trying to solve it. When work involves learning it's enjoyable, but often work doesn't involve learning, or it restricts you to learning things that make money, but that might not be interesting to you. Biological drives also force you to learn, so you can eat and sleep and survive. Practice helps you learn by reinforcing it, but it if you stop learning then it becomes boring and hard, which is why you want to always switch it up, or multitask. Hobbies are a form of play as well, which involve learning and setting your own goals.

The conclusion is **money lowers the desire to learn**. Because it prevents you from solving problems that are interesting. I mean, if you had all the money, then you could do anything. But that makes others suffer. We have to create a world where everybody can solve problems and keep learning, and not be limited. Money prevents that from being possible.

Collecting resources to prevent others from using them, or using them all yourself to a high degree is unsustainable. But learning is sustainable. We can constantly learn, and that only improves our ability to adapt to the environment. But if we continue to harvest and collect resources, we will run out, and it causes harm for others in the system (humans, plants, animals, etc.).

Collecting resources/money naturally results in a positive experience, but is not sustainable. Learning also naturally results in a positive experience, and is sustainable.

So what we need is a way to support learning. You can think of this as funding, but that assumes money is the base. But as noted, money as the base isn't sustainable. We need a way to support learning without shuffling money around. Or, if we do shuffle money around, that it is not hoarded and is not collectable.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(activity)

> "Summing up the formal characteristic of play, we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious' but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings that tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress the difference from the common world by disguise or other means."

> Improvisation, composition, writing, painting, theater, invention, all creative acts are forms of play, the starting place of creativity in the human growth cycle, and one of the great primal life functions. Without play, learning and evolution are impossible. Play is the taproot from which original art springs; it is the raw stuff that the artist channels and organizes with all his learning and technique. (Free Play, p. 42)



> Structured play has clearly defined goals and rules and such play is called a "game". Other play is unstructured or open-ended. Both types of play promote adaptive behaviors and mental states of happiness.

> The California based National Institute for Play describes seven play patterns:[5]
> 
> - Attunement play, which establishes a connection, such as between newborn and mother.
- Body play, in which an infant explores the ways in which his or her body works and interacts with the world, such as making funny sounds or discovering what happens in a fall.
- Object play, such as playing with toys, banging pots and pans, handling physical things in ways that use curiosity.
- Social play, play which involves others in activities such as tumbling, making faces, and building connections with another child or group of children.
- Imaginative or pretend play, in which a child invents scenarios from his or her imagination and acts within them as a form of play, such as princess or pirate play.
- Storytelling play, the play of learning and language that develops intellect, such as a parent reading aloud to a child, or a child retelling the story in his or her own words.
- Creative play, by which one plays with imagination to transcend what is known in the current state, to create a higher state. For example, a person might experiment to find a new way to use a musical instrument, thereby taking that form of music to a higher plane; or, as Einstein was known to do, a person might wonder about things which are not yet known and play with unproven ideas as a bridge to the discovery of new knowledge.

> Modern findings in neuroscience suggest that play promotes flexibility of mind, including adaptive practices such as discovering multiple ways to achieve a desired result, or creative ways to improve or reorganize a given situation (Millar, 1967; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000).

Why does play feel so good? Because you are creating the problems that you are solving. The brain is a prediction machine, so it positively reinforces itself when it can create predictions that prove correct, or learn how to make better predictions.

> In addition, evolutionary psychologists have begun to explore the phylogenetic relationship between higher intelligence in humans and its relationship to play, i.e., the relationship of play to the progress of whole evolutionary groups as opposed to the psychological implications of play to a specific individual.

Play is a good way to capture someone else's attention because it forces the other person to start solving new problems. They can make it fun for themselves if they start to focus on what problems they can see that they want to solve!

> While mimicking adult behavior, attacking actions such as kicking and biting are not completely fulfilled, so playmates do not generally injure each other.

"Playing as preparation". Learning in advance. Gathering knowledge to be used later.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifinality

This is super cool, it's similar to what I've been thinking about how it shouldn't be called "goal", but "end state", making it an open system instead of closed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory)

>  Patrick Bateson maintains that equifinality is exactly what play teaches. In accordance with the flexibility hypothesis, play may teach animals to avoid "false endpoints". In other words, they will harness the childlike tendency to keep playing with something that works "well enough", eventually allowing them to come up with something that might work better, if only in some situations. This also allows mammals to build up various skills that could come in handy in entirely novel situations.[16]

Play creates _new_ problems. You create new problems, and it is inherently interesting to solve them (why? because you inherently know the reason why you created it maybe). New problems can also be encountered in daily life in new situations. But they may not have been created problems, but encountered problems, and so cause frustration and negative feelings. Daily life consists of solving the same problems over and over for the most part, while play gives you a chance to solve new problems, and thus to learn.

So then it's like "flow", or "being in the zone", is _individual play_. Play involves focusing attention to solve problems. Solving problems is learning; learning is solving problems and recording the results.

Different kinds of problems are interesting to different agents depending on their environment and memory (experience/knowledge). Which is why you shouldn't have to force an autistic kid to socialize at recess, or make people good at socializing sit in a chair and read a math book.

Maybe play should, to some degree, be productive. Meaning you learn something that can be applied to solve future problems, or playing with others teaches them new skills, or playing creates products that solve other peoples problems (like programming or engineering). Undproductive play would be stuff you or anybody will never use, or that doesn't ever get circulated in knowledge. Productivity is sort of a spectrum.
