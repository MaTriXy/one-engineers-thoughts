Alan Watts:

Person is a mask, persona, sona, the sound through which your voice passes through.

Persons of the drama: the lists of the masks the actors are going to wear.

We have confused the individual with the person, the role you have in society.
 Condenms everyone to perpetual frustration.

Required to do something, but for it to appear as voluntary before we will praise it.

```
process repersonalize
  To get back into being a person. Wearing a mask.
```

A _person_ is the mask you are in a group. It is the immediate identity other individuals give an individual.
