The evolution of intelligence started right after first ability to solve problems appeared. Then it was the evolution of problems encountered that needed to be solved, given the resources available.

So at first, maybe it was about food. No need to represent the organism completely. No ability to at the time. No symbolic language. Just ability to recognize simple patterns and remember that that pattern should be chased and consumed.

Eventually we start to have a rich model of all the objects in the universe. And because we are problem solving machines, we try to come up with solutions that are "pleasant" for all intelligent structures. But this desire, this "problem", only occurs after you have a significant body of knowledge that can be easily consumed by the entire species of intelligent agents.

If it is possible for your brain to understand/learn and solve a particular problem, and it is efficient (it doesn't become the _only_ problem you solve at the expense of others), then a "good" intelligent agent would solve those problems, while a "bad" one would not. This means, if you are able to experience the experience of another intelligent agent, such as fear or pain, then ideally you wouldn't inflict on them fear or pain. You wouldn't kill the animals. But, this is just one problem in the suite of problems you have to solve, so it may not be the most valuable action to perform in the entire network; there might be more valuable problems to solve.

So the problem is, from moment to moment, what are the most valuable problems to be solving, and why?
