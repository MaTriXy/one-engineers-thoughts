> Extending the analysis presented by Zlatev (2003), where meaning was defined
as “the relationship between an organism and its environment, determined by [...]
value” (ibid: 258) the concept of meaning in the present theory presupposes (a)
subject S, (b) a subject-internal value system V and (c) a world in which the subject
(as being-in-the-world) is embedded, W

Meaning is the relationship between an agent and it's environment.
