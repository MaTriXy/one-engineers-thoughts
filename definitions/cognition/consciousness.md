It seems like consciousness is experience? Or maybe, consciousness is the _awareness_ of experience. To have that you need a mind maybe? Or at least the ability to interpret your experience somehow. Consciousness is the "traversal of experience".

C = SUM(E)

Humans are becoming more and more conscious. There is a long evolution of it through human history. We humans think of ourselves as conscious, and wonder about animal and plant consciousness. For ourselves, our civilization has gone through an expansion of consciousness, where before it wasn't even aware of reason as a specific thing, and even later it didn't understand that there was such thing as "objectivity" before science.

So consciousness and experience have a direct relationship.

Since humans have memories with a vast amount of knowledge -- due to the ability to encode knowledge beyond generations with written language -- their experience includes much more information than other patterns of individuals like plants, or rocks.

> there have been proposals for how consciousness would be accounted for in a complete computational theory of the mind, from theorists such as Dennett, Hofstadter, McCarthy, McDermott, Minsky, Perlis, Sloman, and Smith.

> a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli.

> So each instant of consciousness integrates the smells, sounds and sights of that moment of experience. And consciousness is simply the feeling of this integrated information experience.

> Since Tononi’s main assumption is that consciousness is the experience of integrated information, it is the second idea that must be abandoned: brain processes cannot be modelled computationally.
