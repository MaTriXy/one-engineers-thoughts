definition understanding
  ? To understand is to transform an observable information structure into an abstract information structure. ?
  ? To understand is to transform an observation into an abstraction. ?
```

This transformation of one structure into an abstract structure is the main _algorithm_ that is happening!

That algorithm of understanding is dependent on the observations, the observer, and the knowledge of the observer. Those are the inputs to the understanding algorithm

```
algorithm understand
  input observer # which has knowledge
  input observations, set observation

  loop # in parallel probably, `process` or `loop`, maybe they are similar
    observe observation, in observations
      loop # to some limit, until you give up
        when interpret, complete
        otherwise learn
```

How is algorithm related to _process_?

This algorithm of understanding can be used for:

- parsing code
- understanding images
- understanding documents
- understanding videos
- understanding communication
- understanding anything

When something is _unclear_, then you don't understand it. This means there is a logical inconsistency somewhere but you don't know where. It is _contradictory_ if you see the logical mistake. It is _confusing_ if it takes you in a lot of mental directions (logical paths), yet they don't all connect into a single whole. It is _complicated_ if you have to put in a lot of mental effort in order to understand, or perhaps you can't explain it without dedicated practice or deep learning. It is _simple_ if you can understand it just by reading it once. Your first impression is the correct impression.
