A reason is how a solution applies to other solutions or desired states.

If you have no desired end states, then there are no reasons. Without reason, there is no motivation.

One interesting tangent of research from this would be to see if there are just too many people to be solving problems, so people are losing their ability to solve problems, and reason.
