A good explanation can only come from first understanding the customers problems, and tailoring it to that. This is why discovery channel shows about nature talk about species becoming extinct or dying or being eaten, because it's about survival which is a core human problem that everyone can relate to. This is why when they "explain" problems about global warming, they talk about how it will destroy the earth or kill tons of species, because that is easily understandable at a base level from human beings, because it's about survival.

If the customer doesn't have the problem you're trying to sell them on, you either have to make them experience the problem directly, or make the explanation more general so it speaks to a problem they actually have. This is why having a list of all base level human problems will be very helpful for creating explanations. A human must have a problem for it to desire an explanation. If they don't have the problem, they have to learn on their own to have the problem, you can't make them understand the problem.
