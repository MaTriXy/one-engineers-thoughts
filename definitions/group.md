It seems like a group defines sort of a bounded, circular thing. As opposed to set or collection.

Basically just need a base term for "many":

- group
- collection
- set
- list
- container
- set

To group means in some sense they have a similar physical location.

I like the word set the best. I dunno it's hard.
