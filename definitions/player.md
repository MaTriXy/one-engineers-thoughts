> Any participant in a game who (i) has a nontrivial set of strategies (more than one) and (ii) selects among the strategies based on payoffs. If a player is non-strategic, selecting strategies randomly, the player is termed a nature player.

So a player is an _individual_. They choose their actions based on the current situation, based on expected value they will get (payoff).

you can represent any normal form game if it can be modeled as with imperfect information https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLWtcWPi84s

A nash equilibrium always exists for an imperfect information game. That means, there is a way to maximize the payoff for all individuals. Isn't that the key to happiness then? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLWtcWPi84s

```
transform imperfect information game
  into induced normal form game
```

NF -> IIEF -> NF

By converting it to normal form game into "imperfect information extensive form", then back, you will get a simplified game that still has the same equilibria qualities.

TPC backoff game.

A game is an interaction between two or more people that results in different outcomes and happiness levels for the individuals.
