A pattern is a structure? Or is a structure a pattern?

A structure is an information pattern.

pattern vs. structure?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern

> Mathematics is sometimes called the "Science of Pattern", in the sense of rules that can be applied wherever needed

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_theory

> Pattern Theory gives an algebraic framework for
describing patterns as structures regulated by
rules, both local and global. Probability measures
are sometimes superimposed on the image
algebras to account for variability of the
patterns.2

"pattern formation"

> Patterns in nature are visible regularities of form found in the natural world.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterns_in_nature

> arranged in or constituting a constant or definite pattern, especially with the same space between individual instances.

A structure is more like an object than a pattern. All 3 are "recognizable information". An object is something that can stand on its own, that has boundaries, or a clear type or something. A pattern is less structured than an object. So since all 3 are "recognizable", we classify the types of recognizable information, **maybe based on what else they relate to in our mind**.

> Mathematicians seek out patterns[9][10] and use them to formulate new conjectures. 

"pattern" in that sentence comes across like it's before you see structure.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_(psychology)

pattern recognition describes a cognitive process that matches information from a stimulus with information retrieved from memory.

> Patterns are abstract representations of working memory elements. (Ops5)

If a pattern is recognizable information, when it is recognized, it causes an action. This is encapsulated in a _rule_.

  state transition in center like cell division

  identity is like a mirror

  A pattern is a repeatable structure.
  A pattern is a structure that can be repeated.

Does this mean every structure is a pattern?

Categories are generalizations of monoids!

People should be using the word "pattern" instead of "type" when explaining stuff. "It's a perfectly valid pattern", not "it's a perfectly valid type".

No types! Just patterns, the simplest building blocks. Then once we get out of these simple building blocks, you'll be using `action` or `resource` or `human` or things like that.

The act of continuously recognizing patterns is what execution _is_. So by recognizing a pattern of changes, you have an executing program. This means, if you define all the patterns that should be recognized as relations between states, you can construct a machine that recognizes these patterns, and so construct an executing program.

An executing program is continuous pattern recognition.
