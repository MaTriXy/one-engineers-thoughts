Loop quantum gravity.
> We pictured space as a sort of extremely fine fabric that was “weaved” by the loops. Nothing appeared to exist at scales smaller than the structure of the weave itself.

> However, general relativity implies that if
we concentrate too much energy and momentum in a small
region, that region will collapse into a black hole and disappear.
Putting in the numbers, we find that the minimum size of
such a region is of the order of the Planck length – about 1.6×
10–35 m.

> By solving the eigenvalue
problem of the volume operator, we found that the eigenvalues
were discrete – that is, there are elementary quanta of volume,
or elementary “grains of space”. Furthermore, these
quanta of space resided precisely at the nodes of the nets.

> But space is more than just a collection of volume elements.
There is also the key fact that some elements are near to others.
A “link” of the net – i.e. the portion of loop between two
nodes – indicates precisely the quanta of space that are adjacent
to one another. Two adjacent elements of space are separated
by a surface, and the area of this surface turns out to be
quantized as well. In fact, it soon became clear that nodes
carry quantum numbers of volume elements and links carry
quantum numbers of area elements (figure 1).

E(n) is n(n + 1)/2

```
euclidean 3
  ratio
    product n, sum n, 1
    2
```

`n` is because of "translational symmetry" in the euclidean space
`n(n + 1)/2` is because of "rotational symmetry"

> In an affine space, there are instead displacement vectors, also called translation vectors or simply translations, between two points of the space.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space

> Thus it makes sense to subtract two points of the space, giving a translation vector, but it does not make sense to add two points of the space.

affine space
  has subtraction
  doesnt have addition

> Any vector space may be considered as an affine space
> In this case, the elements of the vector space may be viewed either as points of the affine space or as displacement vectors or translations.

This seems like it might be a good way to start modeling. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space#Informal_description

> An affine space[3] is a set A together with a vector space V over a field F and a transitive and free group action of V (with addition of vectors as group action) on A. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_homogeneous_space
