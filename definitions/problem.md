> Backward induction is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem or situation, to determine a sequence of optimal actions. It proceeds by first considering the last time a decision might be made and choosing what to do in any situation at that time.

> The notion of information set was introduced by John von Neumann, motivated by studying the game of Poker.

> In the mathematical optimization method of dynamic programming, backward induction is one of the main methods for solving the Bellman equation.

> In mathematics, management science, economics, computer science, and bioinformatics, dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions - ideally, using a memory-based data structure. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space.

> The act of storing solutions to subproblems is called "memoization".
