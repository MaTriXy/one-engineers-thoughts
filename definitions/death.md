  The loss of information of an individual.

The moment they come together, love brings everything back to the one, it all falls apart again. Separation begins again, and so information gets generated. So it's like universes are cycles of information gain and loss. Love and hate.

So given that it's not always love or always hate, we can experiment with steps just after the origin. They can be combinations of loving and hateful actions. Or, of actions that gain, lose, or keep information.
