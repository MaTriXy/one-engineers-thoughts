State is a property of a structure. It is usually in reference to time. So it has something to do with a relation of a structure to itself at different frames.

A frame is a tick in the universe sorta thing.

> This is also different from the approach that is taken by the fluent calculus, where a state can be a collection of known facts, that is, a possibly incomplete description of the universe.

A state is a set of facts about a universe.

> Roughly speaking, the frame problem (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969) relates to the need for inferring the persistence of some facts of the world after the execution of an action known not to affect them, without having to state that explicitly in the form of frame axioms.

A state is all information structures used in the situation. Relations and objects.

> Environment state is represented as 3D scene graph

Decision cycle or decision loop.

> Transforms continuous information from scene graph into symbolic information in working memory.
