> The traditional account of Roman history, which has come down to us through Livy, Plutarch, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and others, is that in Rome's first centuries it was ruled by a succession of seven kings. The traditional chronology, as codified by Varro, allots 243 years for their reigns, an average of almost 35 years, which, since the work of Barthold Georg Niebuhr, has been generally discounted by modern scholarship. The Gauls destroyed much of Rome's historical records when they sacked the city after the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC (Varronian, according to Polybius the battle occurred in 387/6) and what was left was eventually lost to time or theft. With no contemporary records of the kingdom existing, all accounts of the kings must be carefully questioned.[1]

> The kings, excluding Romulus, who according to legend held office by virtue of being the city's founder, were all elected by the people of Rome to serve for life, with none of the kings relying on military force to gain or keep the throne.

> The insignia of the kings of Rome were twelve lictors wielding the fasces bearing axes, the right to sit upon a Curule chair, the purple Toga Picta, red shoes, and a white diadem around the head. Of all these insignia, the most important was the purple toga.

> The oldest source for this practice in the Ancient Near East came from Mesopotamia. This practice attested at the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C., and it was vigorously pursued by the Assyrian kings, Esarhaddon and his son, Ashurbanipal in the 7th century B.C.[2]

> There were 3 methods to interpret omens, and they were hepatoscopy (i.e. liver divination), lecanomancy, libanomancy. Hepatoscopy is to observe irregularities and abnormalities on the appearance of the entrails of a sacrificial sheep and they were used most in royal services.[2]

> Letters from the city Mari dated at the latest from the 18th century showed that this divinatory practices were not limited to royal court, but also played an important role in everyday life of the people.[2]

> Even since Homeric times, the Greeks paid special attention to these signs: when they saw vultures from the left, another symbol of Zeus, they considered it a bad omen. The cry of a heron or a lightning to the right marked positive and promising omen. In the Greek territory, seers also judged good and bad omens from the unwillingness or willingness of a victim to approach the altar and by the state of its offal when slaughtered.[4]

> Ancient Roman religion employed two distinct types of professional omen readers. Augurs interpreted the flights of birds, while haruspices employed animal sacrifice to obtain the entrails necessary for divination.

> . The Romans, unlike the Greeks, considered that signs from the left were usually favorable and positive, while signs from the right were seen as adverse and negative. However, under Greek influence this procedure began to change and eventually lost its universal weight, meaning that each omen case was to be examined separately.

> In the field of astrology, solar and lunar eclipses (along with the appearance of comets and to some extent the full moon) have often been considered omens of notable births, deaths, or other significant events throughout history in many societies. One biblical example is the Magi in the Gospel of Matthew who predicted the birth of Jesus after seeing the Star of Bethlehem.

> Under the influence of Greek culture, Mars was identified with the Greek god Ares,[2] whose myths were reinterpreted in Roman literature and art under the name of Mars. But the character and dignity of Mars differed in fundamental ways from that of his Greek counterpart, who is often treated with contempt and revulsion in Greek literature.[3] Mars was a part of the Archaic Triad along with Jupiter and Quirinus, the latter of whom as a guardian of the Roman people had no Greek equivalent. Mars' altar in the Campus Martius, the area of Rome that took its name from him, was supposed to have been dedicated by Numa, the peace-loving semi-legendary second king of Rome. Although the center of Mars' worship was originally located outside the sacred boundary of Rome (pomerium), Augustus made the god a renewed focus of Roman religion by establishing the Temple of Mars Ultor in his new forum.[4]

> Venus (/ˈviːnəs/, Classical Latin: /ˈwɛnʊs/) is the Roman goddess whose functions encompassed love, beauty, sex, fertility, prosperity and desire. In Roman mythology, she was the mother of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy and fled to Italy. Julius Caesar claimed her as his ancestor. Venus was central to many religious festivals, and was revered in Roman religion under numerous cult titles.

This is the day we go out and get drunk in college.

> Venus embodies sex, love, beauty, enticement, seduction, and persuasive female charm among the community of immortal gods; in Latin orthography, her name is indistinguishable from the Latin noun venus ("sexual love" and "sexual desire"), from which it derives.[

> In myth, Venus-Aphrodite was born of sea-foam. Roman theology presents Venus as the yielding, watery female principle, essential to the generation and balance of life.

>  Jupiter was the chief deity of Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, he negotiates with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of Roman religion such as sacrifice.

Jupiter is the trust between work and play.

> Sacrificial victims (hostiae) offered to Jupiter were the ox (castrated bull), the lamb (on the Ides, the ovis idulis) and the wether (on the Ides of January).[43] The animals were required to be white. The question of the lamb's gender is unresolved; while a lamb is generally male, for the vintage-opening festival the flamen Dialis sacrificed a ewe.[44] This rule seems to have had many exceptions, as the sacrifice of a ram on the Nundinae by the flaminica Dialis demonstrates. During one of the crises of the Punic Wars, Jupiter was offered every animal born that year.[45]

> The Capitoline Hill (/ˈkæpɨtəlaɪn/[1] or /kəˈpɪtɵlaɪn/;[2] Latin: Collis Capitōlīnus [ˈkɔllɪs kapɪtoːˈliːnʊs]; Italian: Campidoglio [kampiˈdɔʎʎo]), between the Forum and the Campus Martius, is one of the Seven Hills of Rome.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_hills_of_Rome

> The seven hills' denizens began to participate in a series of religious games, which began to bond the groups.

> Tradition holds that Romulus founded the original city on the Palatine Hill and that the seven hills were first occupied by small settlements that were not grouped nor recognized as a city called Rome. The seven hills' denizens began to participate in a series of religious games, which began to bond the groups. The city of Rome, thus, came into being as these separate settlements acted as a group, draining the marshy valleys between them and turning them into markets (fora in Latin). Later, in the early 4th century BC, the Servian Walls were constructed to protect the seven hills.

> The Ides (the midpoint of the month, with a full moon) was sacred to Jupiter, because on that day heavenly light shone day and night.
Some (or all) Ides were Feriae Iovis, sacred to Jupiter.
> On the Ides, a white lamb (ovis idulis) was led along Rome's Sacred Way to the Capitoline Citadel and sacrificed to him.[72] Jupiter's two epula Iovis festivals fell on the Ides, as did his temple foundation rites as Optimus Maximus, Victor, Invictus and (possibly) Stator.[73]

> The Romans of the Republic, like the Etruscans, used a "market week" of eight days, marked as A to H in the calendar. A nundinum was the market day; etymologically, the word is related to novem, "nine", because the Roman system of counting was inclusive. The market "week" is the nundinal cycle. Since the length of the year was not a multiple of eight days, the letter for the market day (known as a "nundinal letter") changed every year. For example, if the letter for market days in some year was A and the year was 355 days long, then the letter for the next year would be F.

> The nundinal cycle formed one rhythm of day-to-day Roman life; the market day was the day when country people would come to the city, and the day when city people would buy their eight days' worth of groceries.
>  For this reason, a law was passed in 287 BC (the Lex Hortensia) that forbade the holding of meetings of the comitia (for example to hold elections) on market days, but permitted the holding of legal actions. In the late republic, a superstition arose that it was unlucky to start the year with a market day (i.e., for the market day to fall on 1 January, with a letter A), and the pontiffs, who regulated the calendar, took steps to avoid it.

> Because the nundinal cycle was absolutely fixed at eight days under the Republic, information about the dates of market days is one of the most important tools used for working out the Julian equivalent of a Roman date in the pre-Julian calendar. In the early Empire, the Roman market day was occasionally changed. The details of this are not clear, but one likely explanation put forward is that it would be moved by one day if it fell on the same day as the festival of Regifugium, an event that could occur at intervals of three years. The reason for this movement has not been explained.

> The nundinal cycle was eventually replaced by the modern seven-day week, which first came into use in Italy during the early imperial period,[20] after the Julian calendar had come into effect in 45 BC. The system of nundinal letters was also adapted for the week. (See dominical letter.) For a while, the week and the nundinal cycle coexisted, but by the time the week was officially adopted by Constantine in AD 321, the nundinal cycle had fallen out of use. For further information on the week, see week and days of the week.

> How years were identified during the Roman monarchy is not known. During the Roman Republic, years were named after the consuls, who were elected annually (see List of Republican Roman Consuls). Thus, the name of the year identified a consular term of office, not a calendar year. For example, 205 BC was "The year of the consulship of Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus and Publius Licinius Crassus", who took office on 15 March of that year, and their consular year ran until 14 March 204 BC. Lists of consuls were maintained in the fasti.

The day of abundance.

```
Saturday == day of abundance.
Friday = day of test of system.
Thursday = day of love
Wednesday = day of gain / tricks
Tuesday = war day
Monday = new day, dark day.
Sunday = rest day.
```

So tuesday would be the best day then, when people are looking for good against the bad.

7 days then:

1. monday: understand (see in dark)
1. tuesday: diverge (go to war, exploding, destroying, creating)
1. wednesday: converge (be persuasive, come together, narrowing, refining)
1. thursday: prototype (make love, generate, make, build, agreeing)
1. friday: test (verifying, observing, summarizing, analyzing)
1. saturday: celebrate (reap rewards)
1. sunday: rest (get back to other things in life, let that experience join with the rest)

But then days are just averages. These are the 7 parts to the cycle. So 7 is the loop, but there can be several interwoven 7-loops, a game of 7. Life Game. Week Game.

> ​Counting 12 with one hand for every finger on the other hand.
Thus 12 being a standard number in the context. The Babylonian even developed the sexageaimal system which had 60 as its base. This was actually very close to our current decimal system. (Maybe providing possibility of its origin too.)

> It was originated with Romans,  they started with 10 month calendar originally named as Martius, Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quintilis, Sextilis, September, October, November and December.  This calendar left 60 or so days unaccounted for. 

> Julius Caesar's astronomers explained the need for 12 months in a year and the addition of a leap year to synchronize with the seasons. The months Januarius and Februarius were later added to the end of the year to account for the 60 spare days.  

https://www.quora.com/Why-do-clocks-have-12-hours

> The original 12 hour system used by the Egyptians and Greeks was twelve hours of night and twelve hours of day with the hour length actually changing with the seasons.

Fingers are each 3. So you have 12 in each hand. So 60 is 5 x 12 (5 fingers on right hand)

Then split each half of day (2 parts), into 12. Then half a lite/dark is 6. Etc.

12 then in cycle of earth around sun, but a complex 12 puzzle.

> The Sumerians watched the Sun, Moon, and the five visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), primarily for omens. They did not try to understand the motions physically. They did, however, notice the circular track of the Sun's annual path across the sky and knew that it took about 360 days to complete one year's circuit. Consequently, they divided the circular path into 360 degrees to track each day's passage of the Sun's whole journey. This probably happened about 2400 BC.

> That's how we got a 360 degree circle. Around 1500 BC, Egyptians divided the day into 24 hours, though the hours varied with the seasons originally. Greek astronomers made the hours equal. About 300 to 100 BC, the Babylonians subdivided the hour into base-60 fractions: 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute. The base 60 of their number system lives on in our time and angle divisions.

> 360 is an incredibly abundant number, which means that there are many factors.

> τ , which is just 2π

> My guess is that the Babylonian system is the main reason for that. It is also worth noting that the smallest regular polygon has all its angles equal to 60 degrees; historically the choice might have been made first for the equilateral triangle.

60 + 60 + 60 = 180 = degrees in a triangle.

> Ancient civilizations had used a system of counting numbers with fingers on their palms. Later they found it is easier to count higher numbers with their fingers only but with the folds of their fingers on their palm to 12 excluding the thumb. Further by folding each finger of the other hand they counted up to 60, that is 12 multiplied by 5. Old sailors from Greece and southern Europe used to count with their fingers only in a similar way. 

> An hour is divided by 60 to count a smaller portion of an hour and further a minute is divided by 60 to get a second.

> Ancient people knew that climatic conditions were changing and repeating in about 360 days, by observing natural events like migration of birds, mating season of animals, flowering of trees etc.

> By observing the stars position they knew it came back every 360 days

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-day_calendar

> It is a simplification to a 360-day year, consisting of 12 months of 30 days each.

> Romans initially used a calendar which had 360 days, with varying length of months.[1][2]
The Rig Veda describes a calendar with twelve months and 360 days.[3]
In the Mayan Long Count Calendar, the equivalent of the year, the tun, was 360 days.[4]

> Today, the solar year is 365.242199 days long (or 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 46 seconds)

> Note: there is another perfect calendar recently proposed for our current cycles of the earth and the moon. If the solar year were exactly 364 days (instead of 365.24 ) and lunar cycle exactly 28 days (instead of  29.53), we would have another “perfect calendar” based on 13 months of 28 days per month, with each month having 4 weeks of  7 days. Such calendar was proposed as “13 Moon Calendar”  (discussed in this article) with the 365th day called the “Day Out of Time”.

> The radius of the Earth’s orbit is about 400 times the radius of the Moon’s orbit. The Moon makes about 13 revolutions in the course of a year. The speed of the Earth around the Sun is about 30 times the speed of the Moon around the Earth.

> 235 lunar months made up almost exactly 19 solar years (period called Metonic Cycle). 

> Meton of Athens was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, geometer, and engineer who lived in Athens in the 5th century BC. He is best known for calculations involving the eponymous 19-year (6,939.602 days) Metonic cycle which he introduced in 432 BC into the lunisolar Attic calendar. 

> The linking of the sun and the moon meant that the calendar was lunisolar. Twelve lunar months add up to about 354 days, eleven days or so shorter than the solar year. Under a purely lunar calendar, such as the Islamic one, the months creep backwards over the years with no relation between the months and the seasons. In Greece with its pronounced seasons this had to be prevented. By tying the start of their year to the solstice, the Athenians allowed the months to relate, with some elasticity, to the seasons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_calendar#Lunisolar_calendar

> This still left the problem that twelve lunar months fall eleven days short of the solar year. To make up for this, an extra month had to be inserted ("intercalated") about every third year, leading to a leap year of about 384 days.

> So normal years contained 12 lunar cycles and then when it was judged that the months had slid back enough, a year of 13 cycles was used to realign the lunar and solar years.

12, occasionally 13. 13 is the unlucky number.

> This extra month was achieved by repeating an existing month. That is to say, the same month name was used twice in a row. Handbooks usually refer to the sixth month, Poseideon, as the month that was repeated, but months 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8 are all attested as being doubled. (Hannah 2005: 43)

> Various cycles were in existence for working out exactly which years needed to take a thirteen month. A nineteen-year cycle known as the Metonic cycle which was developed at Athens by the astronomers Meton and Euctemon (known to be active in 432 BC), could have been used to pattern the insertion of leap years so as to keep the lunar and solar years aligned with some accuracy. There is, however, no sign that any such system was in fact used at Athens, where the calendar seems to have been administered on an ad hoc basis.

The Athenian months were named after gods and festivals.

>  In this the calendar differed from the Mesopotamian models that lie behind all Greek lunar calendars.

Mesopotamian -> Greek -> Roman.

>  In the Sumerian and Babylonian prototypes, for instance, the months were named after the main agricultural activity practised in that month.

> Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian empires

> In Mesopotamia the solar year was divided into two seasons, the "summer," which included the barley harvests in the second half of May or in the beginning of June, and the "winter," which roughly corresponded to today's fall-winter. Three seasons (Assyria) and four seasons (Anatolia) were counted in northerly countries, but in Mesopotamia the bipartition of the year seemed natural. As late as c. 1800 BC the prognoses for the welfare of the city of Mari, on the middle Euphrates, were taken for six months.

> The months began at the first visibility of the New Moon, and in the 8th century BC court astronomers still reported this important observation to the Assyrian kings. The names of the months differed from city to city, and within the same Sumerian city of Babylonia a month could have several names, derived from festivals, from tasks (e.g., sheep shearing) usually performed in the given month, and so on, according to local needs. On the other hand, as early as the 27th century BC, the Sumerians had used artificial time units in referring to the tenure of some high official--e.g., on N-day of the turn of office of PN, governor. The Sumerian administration also needed a time unit comprising the whole agricultural cycle; for example, from the delivery of new barley and the settling of pertinent accounts to the next crop. This financial year began about two months after barley cutting. For other purposes, a year began before or with the harvest. This fluctuating and discontinuous year was not precise enough for the meticulous accounting of Sumerian scribes, who by 2400 BC already used the schematic year of 30  12 = 360 days.

> In the 6th century B.C. the scribes of Enuma Anu Enlil were a group of men at the Babylonian court who were experts in astronomy and astrology. Texts refer to this group of scribes, but we do not know exactly who they were, what they did and how they were trained. However, for hundreds of years the scribes kept accurate records of natural events on the earth and in the sky in order to predict the future.

> Sumerians also developed a rudimentary system of astrological divination for use in foreseeing the future of city-states and battles, but not for predicting personal futures.

> The month began at sunset, with the first visible (thinnest) crescent of the New Moon, which is visible about 18 hours after conjunction or about 36 hours after the disappearance of the Old Moon's thinnest crescent, (under certain circumstances this can be as short as 22 to 24 hours after disappearance of the Old Moon, with a clear western horizon).

> The lunar calendar was synchronized with the solar year (the seasons) by intercalation of a leap month every few years.

> The Sumerians of Babylon were probably the first people to make a calendar. They used the phases of the moon, counting 12 lunar months as a year. To make up for the difference between this year and the year of the seasons, they inserted an extra month in the calendar about every four years.

> The early Romans also used a calendar based on the moon. The year in this calendar was 355 days long. The months corresponding to March, May, July, and October each had 31 days; February had 28 days; and the rest had 29. An extra month was added about every fourth year.

When Babylon became the political center of the Euphrates valley in the time of Hammurabi (18th century BC), he slowly started to rise to the position of the head of the Babylonian pantheon, a position he fully acquired by the second half of the second millennium BC. In the city of Babylon, he resided in the temple Esagila. "Marduk" is the Babylonian form of his name

> According to The Encyclopedia of Religion, the name Marduk was probably pronounced Marutuk. The etymology of the name Marduk is conjectured as derived from amar-Utu ("bull calf of the sun god Utu").[2] The origin of Marduk's name may reflect an earlier genealogy, or have had cultural ties to the ancient city of Sippar (whose god was Utu, the sun god), dating back to the third millennium BC.[3]
