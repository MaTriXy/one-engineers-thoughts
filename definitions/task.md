A task is a "chosen solution". A task is the solution that an intelligent agent uses in an environment.

```
definition task
  A chosen solution to a problem.

This is why tasks are bad. You may have chosen the solution without having fully thought about the problem or other possible solutions.

A task is something the intelligent agent does or plans to do. So the action selection cycle creates a task, which should be executed.

> The understanding phase includes
sensing the environment, detecting features, recognizing
objects and categories, and building internal representations.
The attending phase is responsible for deciding what
portion of this representation should be attended to and broadcast
to the rest of the system, making it the current contents
of consciousness. This portion allows the agent to choose
an appropriate action to execute in the action phase. These
phases, their timing, and empirical support have been described
elsewhere (Madl, Baars, & Franklin, 2011; Franklin,
Madl, Dâ€™Mello, & Snaider, in review).
