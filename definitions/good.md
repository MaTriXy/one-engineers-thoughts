The actions that are good and bad, right and wrong.

The stoics have the answer on what "the good life" is. They've already figured it out, so that's the ideal of human action. Answered! The tao te ching seems like it has similar insights.

Now the problem is, how to formalize this more clearly. Then how to transform into actual rules on how much physical resources you'd need to live a good life, so it can be executed by software and 3d printed hardware.

> Good Sir, you are an Athenian, a citizen of the greatest city with the greatest reputation for both wisdom and power; are you not ashamed of your eagerness to possess as much wealth, reputation, and honors as possible, while you do not care for nor give thought to wisdom or truth or the best possible state of your soul [29e].[6]

> Virtues are states of the soul.

the soul is the sum of states of a self
a virtue is some state or pattern in the soul

> this state of the soul, moral virtue, is the most important good
> Someone with a virtuous soul is better off than someone who is wealthy and honoured but whose soul is corrupted by unjust actions. This view is confirmed in the Crito, where Socrates gets Crito to agree that the perfection of the soul, virtue, is the most important good:

> Here Socrates argues that life is not worth living if the soul is ruined by wrongdoing.

> In summary, Socrates seems to think that virtue is both necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia. A person who is not virtuous cannot be happy, and a person with virtue cannot fail to be happy. We shall see later on that Stoic ethics takes its cue from this Socratic insight.

> But if eudaimonia is to be achieved through the satisfaction of desire, whereas being just or acting justly requires suppression of desire, then it is not in the interests of the strong man to act according to the dictates of conventional morality.

> In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious.

> The argument of the Republic is lengthy and complex. In brief, Plato argues that virtues are states of the soul, and that the just person is someone whose soul is ordered and harmonious, with all its parts functioning properly to the person’s benefit. In contrast, Plato argues that the unjust man’s soul, without the virtues, is chaotic and at war with itself, so that even if he were able to satisfy most of his desires, his lack of inner harmony and unity thwart any chance he has of achieving eudaimonia. Plato’s ethical theory is eudaimonistic because it maintains that eudaimonia depends on virtue. On Plato’s version of the relationship, virtue is depicted as the most crucial and the dominant constituent of eudaimonia.

> According to Aristotle, eudaimonia actually requires activity, action, so that it is not sufficient for a person to possess a squandered ability or disposition.

Aristotle messed it all up! He gave into the king http://www.ancient.eu/aristotle/.

He tailored the philosophy to the king, and so misdirected us for 2000 years.

> four (so called “cardinal”) virtues: Courage, Justice, Self-discipline, and Wisdom.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_virtues

1. the ability to judge between actions with regard to appropriate actions at a given time.
2. justice, fairness, the most extensive and most important virtue
3. temperance, also known as restraint, the practice of self-control, abstention, and moderation tempering the appetition.
4. Courage (ἀνδρεία, andreia; Latin: Fortitudo): also named fortitude, forbearance, strength, endurance, and the ability to confront fear, uncertainty, and intimidation.

> These were derived initially from Plato's scheme, discussed in Republic Book IV, 426-435 (and see Protagoras 330b, which also includes piety (hosiotes)); expanded on by Cicero, and adapted by Saint Ambrose, Augustine of Hippo, and Thomas Aquinas (see Summa Theologica II(I).61). The term "cardinal" comes from the Latin cardo or hinge; the cardinal virtues are so called because they are the basic virtues required for a virtuous life. They are also related to the Quadrivium.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium

> St. Ambrose (330s-397 AD) was the first to use the expression “cardinal virtues.” “And we know that there are four cardinal virtues temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude.” (Commentary on Luke, V, 62)

> a good, eudaimonic life requires the development of an expanding circle of concern that starts with the Self (both mind and body) [7], easily and naturally includes family and friends, and one should practice its expansion to fellow citizens, humankind at large, and eventually nature as a whole

> The Stoics referred to this concept as “philanthropy,” or love of humanity.

> A foundational Stoic precept is to make the distinction between what we can affect (our own attitudes and actions) and what we cannot (external events). Happiness then is available to the person who focuses on what s/he can control. This is achieved by way of the general practice to “follow nature,” by which the Stoics didn’t mean anything like tree hugging or the Paleo diet, but rather both developing the natural human propensity for reason, and accepting that whatever happens is in accord with the way the world works, and it is therefore irrational to oppose it or to become upset by it.

> In fact, the Stoics, such as Chrysippus of Soli, seem to have endorsed a type of deflationary view of truth, and were particularly interested in the “sayables” — i.e., in whatever underlies the meaning of everything we think. A subset of sayables is constituted by the so-called assertibles, which are characterized by truth values. The assertibles in turn are the smallest expressions in a deductive system, so including them in one’s logic gives origin to a system of propositional logic in which arguments are composed of assertibles.

Conditional: "If it is light, it is day."
Conjunctive: "It is light and it is day."
Disjunctive: "Either it is light or it is day."
Causal: "It is light because it is day."
Likely: "It is more likely that it is day than that it is night."

> b) The world works in a deterministic way (fate);

> The classical Stoics were compatibilists, believing in complete determinism and also free will, and asserting directly the the two do not conflict. They asserted that there are no events that don't follow inevitably from causes. They even do not have an issue with the "beginning" of the universe, because they believed it to be cyclic, extending infinitely into the past and future.

> "Fate," he says, "is an eternal and unalterable series of circumstances, and a chain rolling and entangling itself through an unbroken series of consequences, from which it is fashioned and made up."

> On Providence, he says that εἱμαρμένη is "an orderly series, established by nature, of all events, following one another and joined together from eternity, and their unalterable interdependence."

> early Taoism was a response to the (excessively) formal systems proposed by Confucius and others, so it generally rejects any sort of categorization or formal logic.

> Also, early Taoism would reject the recognition of specific virtues or duties, as it regards such things as poor substitutes which should be unnecessary if one is following the true Way. If you need to recognize virtue, then that implies that vice has already appeared, etc.
