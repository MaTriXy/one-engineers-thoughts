An algorithm for finding information structures matching criteria.

To search is to find. To find is to identify.

To have a pattern in mind, and to test it against each structure to see if it matches, or somehow fits criteria/query.

So problem finding is a search for problems. To search for problems, you look for possible end states, or differences from the current state. Then you see if solutions to these problems would help you solve the main problem. That is, finding connections between them.
