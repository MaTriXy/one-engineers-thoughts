> In physics, a frame of reference (or reference frame) consists of an abstract coordinate system and the set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

> In Einsteinian relativity, reference frames are used to specify the relationship between a moving observer and the phenomenon or phenomena under observation.

> The frame problem is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment.

> Difference is a key concept of philosophy, denoting the process or set of properties by which one entity is distinguished from another within a relational field or a given conceptual system.

Ordered sequence of structures.

If information is random and fluctuating, it creates differences. A current structure and a previous structure. This difference defines a frame. A frame is the current structure.

A frame is a structure with regard to a reference frame?

A frame is a relation between a structure and the next structure?

The structure of the universe before it changes.

The structure of information before it changes. This frames it as relative as well. It's a relation between a structure now, and after it changes.

The relation between a structure now and when the universe changes.
The structure now, vs. after when the universe changes.

Relation between two states of the universe, and the structure of the universe in the observed/current state.

The currently observable universe. And since an observation is a relation between two information structure, it is the relation between an observer and a universe.

The "current" or "immediate" relation between the observer and the universe, "during" planck's constant. All those words though are "time" words, hard to not be circular.

Frames are discrete.

Observations cannot occur more than plank's constant, or speed of light, or something.

Observations can be made in the current frame.
Predictions can be made about the next frame.
