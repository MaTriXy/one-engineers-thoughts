> It translates several Buddhist terms and concepts, most notably bodhi,[note 2] kensho and satori. Related terms from Asian religions are moksha (liberation) in Hinduism, Kevala Jnana in Jainism and ushta in Zoroastrianism.

> In Christianity, the word "enlightenment" is rarely used, except to refer to the Age of Enlightenment and its influence on Christianity. Roughly equivalent terms in Christianity may be illumination, kenosis, metanoia, revelation, salvation and conversion.

So then, changing your brain chemistry, is always happening. Everything we do changes it.

But the problem is, when you injest molecules that directly manipulate your mental states, you may find connections to things and see things in a very different way than the other person. You may be making logical leaps that are so clear in your head, but yet are too hard to explain in a simple way quickly in verbal communication. So you _appear_ as crazy. You _appear_ as possessed.

Then if your statements are perceived as bad, such as talking about the spirit and the dead perhaps, then you may be called a witch, but if you see an obvious thing that others don't in the future (from making different logical connections), then they will think you are a _seer_. Or if they can find connections that you can't about your own life, then you are a _psychic_. All of these things have to do with a relation to the _primary_ experience people are having, which leads them to only understand certain _facts_ in the world, but ignore or not see others.

So when a molecule manipulates your brain, it makes it possible to follow different logical paths.

You are _crazy_ when you make a single logical error, then expand on that error until all of a sudden you are 360 degrees from your original perspective. My dad used to say that about my mom. She would tell a small lie, whether on purpose or unknowingly, and then believe that. Then repeat, until in a few years, she believed things that were not real. And they call this _schizophrenia_.

At this point, your memories start getting all messed up. Since memories are associative, if you associate them in the wrong way, you have to go back through them all and update them all. That's why it takes _work_ if you want to improve yourself.

But this work can be done for you if you find someone who can communicate to you like a _sage_. They will know exactly how to get into your memory, and navigate it through a series of changes, until the associations are cleaned up and even optimized. That is the purpose of a psychologist or psychiatrist, or even just a good friend.

So it all boils down to:

```
definition perspective
  world of individual

perspective common 
  based on communication between individuals

perspective different
  where you can't follow the logic, and there is not enough time to explain
```

If there is a different perspective, that can't be logically followed easily, then it can be interpretted in many different ways based on the individual interpreting it:

```
person crazy
  if they can identify the lie, but the person telling can't, and they don't believe it, but they are in control

person possessed
  if they are not in control of their actions (which may happen for many different physical reasons)

person witch
  if they are telling of something scary

person prophet
  if they are telling about the future

person psychic
  if they are telling more about the person than they know of themselves

person schizophrenic
  if they hear voices, or their brain is otherwise out of order

person wise
  if they use the substance and yet can still communicate effectively with the others.

person shaman
  if they are performing a ritual and explaining some part of the unknown
```

Druggy only comes into it when they are not being useful to society. Instead, they spend money and do nothing but experience the drug. This might be pleasurable for them, but not many other people.

So all of these different things are just how people interpret your message. They are all basically the result of _differences in understanding and experience_.

But then we realized there were actually a bunch of different _brain states_. There are _mental_ illnesses.

An illess is a disease. A dis-ease, is something that is not easy to deal with. It is something that is dis ordered, it doesn't fit with the existing order of things. So anything that doesn't fit with the existing order is a disease.

```
definition disease
  Any patterns that doesn't fit with the existing patterns.
```

You can then frame this as a _problem_ if you want, but it's all based on _perspective_.

We can then just call this, a _bug_. An error.

An _error_ is a _mis-take_, that you judged but were incorrect. This can be considered a disease, if you consistently make the bad errors, because then you aren't _fitting well within the existing system_.
