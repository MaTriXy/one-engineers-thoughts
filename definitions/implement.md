definition implement
  put (a decision, plan, agreement, etc.) into effect
```

If an effect is the change in structure, then to implement means to change structure.

An implementation is a symbolic information structure transformed into a concrete/physical information structure.

To implement is the reverse of to understand? If to understand is to transform an observable information structure into an abstract information structure, then to implement is to take that abstract information structure and make it into an observable information structure.
