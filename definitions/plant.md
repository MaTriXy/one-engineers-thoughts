note beer
  Beer is one of the world's oldest prepared beverages, possibly dating back to the early Neolithic or 9500 BC, when cereal was first farmed,[12] and is recorded in the written history of ancient Iraq and ancient Egypt.[13] Archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilizations.[14]

This is because of how their bodies interact with each other. It is a long and complex dance of molecules through the body. It broadens our perspective, and soon we see new patterns emerge.

Shifting around in these different world gives us new experiences. If we observe these experiences, and analyze them, they will become knowledge. We will become more aware of the world and how it works. Eventually, we may become completely fulfilled.

But if we get stuck on one particular path, we stay there. We may be fulfilled, or may not be.
