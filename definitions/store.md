definition store
  ? Can get and set information structures. ?
  ? A structure capable of representing information structures. (with some level of permanance) ?
```

Because a store has a _capacity_, it is in some sense not a static object. It is a process. A store _encodes_ information, means that it has a function. That's what it _does_, not what it _is_.

It's a structure that contains information structures.
