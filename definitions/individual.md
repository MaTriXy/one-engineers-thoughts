```
definition individual
  A pattern in a collection.

definition collection
  A pattern of individuals.
```

Since a pattern is recognizable information, this says that an individual is _anything we recognize as part of something else_. This means, an individual is any _pattern_ a _sage_ (fully conscious self) can _know_.

```coffee
definition individual
  Any pattern a sage can know.
```

Since a pattern is recognizable information, an individual is any information a sage can recognize.

```coffee
definition individual
  Any information a sage can recognize.
```

This implies that an individual that is _not_ a sage may not recognize all individuals. This is the basis of inequality. _Not all individuals recognize all individuals_.

This means:

```coffee
individual a
  ask Is a an individual?
    say yes
  ask Is b an individual?
    say no

individual b
  ask Is a an individual?
    say no
  ask Is b an individual?
    say yes
```

From its perspective, an individual is a _self_. So:

```coffee
equal individual, self
  given transform, in perspective
```

They're just different _projections_ of the underlying information, either from the observer or from the individual perspective.

Therefore:

```coffee
definition self
  Any information a sage can recognize.
  A pattern in a collection.
  A part in relation to a whole.
```

As sage is an _all knowing individual_.

So at the base, the model of an individual includes the definition of an _observer_ who is modeling something. So it is inherently _relational_. This is because there is a _part_ (an individual) that is in _relation_ to a _whole_.

```coffee
definition individual
  A part in relation to a whole.
```

This means, everything is an individual. Therefore, everything is a self.

The next question is, what is the _experience_ of the self? Every self has an experience.

To _know_ some information is to be able to use that information in problem solving. This requires a memory, and ability to use this memory to solve problems. In essence, it is _doing_ from _experience_.

```coffee
conscious self
aware self
free self # free from being controlled by anything, able to watch your experience as a self.
```

Or maybe, a _sage_. This is the _sage_.

```js
/**
 * An individual is a whole of another group of individuals.
 *
 * Every individual has experience. Some individuals develop a complex
 * society such that the upper individual is conscious of it's experience.
 *
 * An individual must be capable of evolving to something that can create another layer of individual.
 *
 * Individuals have _natural_ abilities.
 * These are abilities that are built into them.
 * This means that individuals from the lower layer are being used at this upper layer.
 * Examples include:
 *
 * - senses (skin, eyes, ears, nose, brain)
 * - organs (heart, lungs, etc.)
 * - activities (need to sleep, eat, drink, etc.)
 *
 * These are internal to the individual. They are _innate to it's being_.
 *
 * Then there are _learned abilities_. These are ones acquired through experience. This is where play comes in. Play is the way for individuals to learn from experience. This learning adds new abilities to the individual. Eventually, if they can symbolically represent language, and can manipulate it consciously (thinking/imagining about the letters themselves), then they can share knowledge with each other. Then when they learn to externally encode knowledge (as in paper with pen), then they can exponentially increase their knowledge.
 *
 * So the highest individuals are able to effectively share knowledge with each other, and absorb it from each other. This is the main optimization problem.
 *
 * So all individuals have some sort of memory. They require a memory. This is how, at the base level, we can say information is at the base, an individual memory. So _information is an evolving memory_.
 *
 * So the simplest individual is a fact. Which is a memory of which we cannot decode. It is something which we have not yet been able to observe. So we can look for the simplest piece of information, and start from there as a model of computation. A simple information recorder that has a memory, and is capable of reproduction.
 *
 * @param {Whole} whole The whole that the individual is constructed from.
 *
 * Actually, the _whole_ can be abstracted away into a simple _encode_ function. This encoding function is based on ability of individual. So if individual can't encode, then it does not matter.
