So a property is also one of those words that's part of a spectrum. When you conceptualize information as objects, you talk about properties. But maybe if you talk about structures, you don't talk about properties but relations? Something like that.

```coffee
definition property
  A property is a relation between a type and other types.
```

This means a type is composed of named relations with other types. A property is a relatin between two+ types, where the focus is on the "current" type.

The type dsl is a special case for generating a pattern from other types.
