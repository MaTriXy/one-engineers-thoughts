Intelligence is when a mental structure reacts into some other mental structure at the same level of abstraction. The "conscious level of abstraction" is where intelligence occurs, when you can integrate information from every aspect of your survival and data to day activities into mental structures, and start being intelligent from that level of abstraction. Intelligence is the result of this level of abstraction.

So intelligence is at a conscious or meta-cognitive level of abstraction.
