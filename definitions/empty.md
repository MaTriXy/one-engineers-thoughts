This is information.

In the beginning, there was nothing. There was no information. And that was the first information.

This first piece of information was the first fact about the universe.

And from that fact, we could then state more facts. We could state that, now there was information. This is a new type of information.

```
before nothing
after something, fact 1

before fact 1
after fact 2, based on fact 1
```

So this forms a tree of facts. In a sense, facts about the universe are going on record. Information is being recorded.

This creates an information explosion.

## The Information Explosion

So what exactly happens during the second generation of information in this simple system?

After the first fact is recorded, all there is is a fact. But this is a fact in itself: the fact that there is currently only 1 fact present.

So we can create this fact. This fact is based on the _observation_ of the original fact, the original piece of information. So in a sense, it is _derived_ from the original fact, the original record. So now we have two facts:

```coffee
let fact(1), observe existence
let fact(2), observe fact(1)
```

Then we can keep recognizing mathematical patterns in this system.

```coffee
let fact(1), observe existence
let fact(2), observe fact(1)
let fact(3), observe before fact(1), fact(2)
```

```coffee
let fact(1), observe existence
let fact(2), observe fact(1)
let fact(3), observe before fact(1), fact(2)
let fact(4), observe first fact(1), in fact(3)
let fact(5), observe last fact(2), in fact(3)
```

Basically, what is the base mathematical observations that need to occur in order for the system to evolve into complex patterns? And what level of memory does the "individual" have in this case? The individual _fact_. And who is doing the recognition? The individuals need to be doing the recognition I think, but then how does the whole start controlling the parts (the individuals)? And where is the computational power coming from? The computational power can come from within the mathematical patterns perhaps! This way it doesn't need to behave like a cellular automaton, but could.
