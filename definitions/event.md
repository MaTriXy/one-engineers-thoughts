definition event
  Reconstruction of sequence of states by an intelligent agent.

This means that event isn't at an instant. It is a reconstruction from a memory in an intelligent agent.

This is why events in programming languages kind of make sense, but when expanded to the general definition, break down.

Events are like the "shape of action" one author put it. They're basically a privileged chunk of actions.
