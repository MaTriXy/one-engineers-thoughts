To engage someone's attention, to get them interested in _something_, here is what you do:

1. Wait for them to get interested in something _on their own_. They have to run into a problem themselves. You can't tell them about something, or hint at anything. They have to _know_ they got interested in it on their own.
2. When they get interested in something, _engage them_. Let them share their experience with you. Participate in their world.
4. Follow their world wherever it leads. They will then begin to _trust_ you. Trust means that you act fairly. You focus on them, now they will want to focus on you.
3. As you engage them (follow their lead), notice when you don't know something about what they are talking about. Ask them about it. _They might want to know too._ If they don't want to know, then skip it, and just continue participating in their world.
  - Don't ask demeaning questions. Don't ask questions that have obvious answers, because this is a sign you aren't actually listening. If you actually don't know the obvious, say it and ask them to educate you. Even better, because now they are in control! Then have them tie it back to what they were reading, this would really make them learn, and feel like they did it.
  - Know when you are over engaging and underengaging. After a single long-engagement, keep next engagements short. This way, they never get a sense you are helping them. In this way, it feels more natural.
5. Continue doing this, don't take advantage of anything. They are still _vulnerable to collapse_. Let them experience what it is like to move in their own direction, and have somebody else validate their experience and choices. This will build in them confidence.
6. Release them. Let them continue reading or engaging in their problem. Observe if their attention is still focused on it.
7. Interrupt them briefly with a menial task. Something unrelated, like brushing your teeth. Something that doesn't require any thought.
8. Observe if they return their attention back to their original problem.

If they don't build confidence over time, then that's okay. Try a different way next time.

Otherwise, you can explicitly ask them. Do you want to do anything, or is it okay if it's only me that does things and you can come along? This is perfectly okay. Not everyone needs to do things. But occasionally, they will run into a problem, which you can then engage them on, etc.

```coffee
action support
  observe problem, they have # hook
  engage them
  loop
    follow them
    ask them, question
      of some aspect you dont know, that they can still answer you think
  release Let them explore their topic/thing a little more without your distraction
  interrupt Distract them with something menial.
  observe is their attention focused on original problem
```

They must feel like they are actively in control of their life, not someone else.

This supporting builds up their _self confidence_. They now have knowledge that they can solve problems. You are helping them build knowledge that they are good at solving problems. So in the end, they have a lot of examples where they successfully solved problems. That means, they feel capable. They have solved many problems that they encountered in the past.

_Help_ is different from _support_. Help means they asked. Support means they didn't ask.

They also have an experience of your actions when you decide you want to support someone. So if you all of a sudden change your actions to be supportive, but they have a long experience of you acting differently, it will be perceived as "weird". It is not normal. They don't understand why you are doing those actions, it's not what you normally do.

So instead, you should slowly make the change. Do small things, so you give them time to adapt their perception of you.

What happens though is, in society, we ignore others as they run into problems. We tell children in school that they need to stop what they are interested in and focus on something else. This is the worst possible thing we could be doing.
