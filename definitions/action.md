Action is quantized.
Action is discrete.

> Generally, the action takes different values for different paths.[1] Action has the dimensions of [energy]Â·[time], and its SI unit is joule-second. This is the same unit as that of angular momentum.

An action has an effect on a structure. An effect is a changed structure.

A change is a structural difference.

So effects need to be specified for actions. But often high-level actions, we don't know the effects explicitly.

> The frame problem is solved by asserting that the situation after the execution of an action is identical to the one before but for the conditions changed by the action.

> The Situation Calculus and the Fluent Calculus are successful
action formalisms that share many concepts.

All changes to the environment are caused by actions. (in situation calculus and what I think too).

> Possibility of actions leads to the definition of an executable situation.

Actions can only be executed under certain conditions. (preconditions, postconditions, sort of input/output).

All actions are algorithms. The base action is change. It's just a matter of scale.

Actions are intentional changes. Intention requires intelligence. So actions are intelligent. This means the word _reaction_ isn't quite right. We assume reaction is _automattic action_, as if it doesn't require intelligence, but technically action requires intelligence. So instead, _recall_ and _recognition_ are the base causes of change. Recall occurs from non-intelligent structures, and recognition is just when there is intelligence (a cognitive ability).

> An action represents a relation between old states and new states

An action is a relation between two states.

---

An action is a pattern between two states.
An action is a pattern of change between two states.

---

A rule is a pattern recognizer, and the recognition triggers an action, which is a new state because of the recognition.

> The actions form a sort of the domain

Yes! Best definition. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus
