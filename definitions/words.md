# 4-letter words

    + home
    + road
      + fork

    + good (positive experience, "happy")
    + foul (negative experience, "unhappy")
    + past
    + news (present)
    + fate (future)
    + risk (choice)
    + view (take on life/experience, perspective)
      + note (remembered b/c of attention/focus)
      + this
      + that
      + gain (come/rise/birth/good, of a feat)
        + good
        + rich
      + loss (go/fall/death/foul)
        + foul
        + poor
      + myth
      + fact
      + type (types of things)
2. meet (group)
  + pair: two peers
  + tile (2d)
  + cube (3d)
  + mesh
    + nice meet
    + cell
    + tree
    + list
    + pair: two cells
  + mate
  + seed
  + team
  + ship (product/message/code/chip (chip away at goal) created by peer)
  + flow
  + song (flow of meet?, maybe song == flow)
1. game (process, "life", game)
  + path
    + step
4. move (action, how _fast_ moves are made is _time_)
  + deed (cause)
  + chip (effect, game piece you laid down, your _contribution_, the _feat_, therefore, process of contribution, therefore, gift). a chip is your _gift_. so this means a `gift == chip`. so the `look` in the future, in modeling types, is a chip. so a type is a set of gifts in fate, or a set of future/_late moves_ with _chips_ in _game_. therefore, _this_ is a game, where peers move chips into play. therefore, this is a game. this is a game of life. (say all other interesting statements, in a chain of statements, like a long poem of doctor suess, so that the mind can gain awareness of all the _effects_, all the _chips_ in the _game_. (_this_ is me, writing this note right now, in my current context, part of a large world. therefore, `this` is what i (me) am expressing right now in my mind/body/world/experience). In a sense/form/"word"(way of looking at it, a representation of a thing, an alternative representation of a thing, therefore, a promise?), the _game_ _flows_, as _peers_ _play_ their _chips_. At _each_ _step_, _each_ _peer_ _takes_ _note_ (_sends_ a _note_ into _mind_) of _feel_. This _takes_ _time_. Each _deal_ a _peer_ can/mite _make_ _with_ _every/each_ _meet_ _holds_ _risks_. Each _deal_ a _peer_ can/mite _make_ _with_ _each_ _meet_ _holds_ _risks_. Have to make a decision before choice is gone or world changes. So have to tune/balance your life fast and slow (sometimes do science/research/math, other times do startups/hacks/patches). _Plans_ are for an intermediate, to _automate_ some tasks. Plans can _automate repetitive tasks_. They can _beat_/solve _games_ _with/using_ _loops_ (so it saves ability to solve game again, that is a _plan_). Plan: saved/remembered ability/skill/gift to beat game. So _each_ _peer_ _must_ make a _pick_ (a choice) (_cast_ _some_ die, or _play_ a _chip_) or _stop_ (die/stop/fall). Therefore, _time_ is _based_ on the _game nest_. The _size_ of _time_ is how long it will take to _beat_ the _game nest_. How many _steps_ are _made_ in the _game_ _nest_. Time scale, or _time_ _size_, is the _size_/number of _steps_ to _beat_ a _game_ _nest_. When chips are laid/played, "rules are updated", but it's much deeper than that. _When_ _chips_ are _played_, _news_ of _seeds_ _comes_ (offspring/creations/tools in next frame). _Chips_ are _played_, and the _seeds_ are _grabbed_. Based on _this_ _code_. Based on all the _deals_ _made_ in the _past_. The chips are the input in the pot/_pool_. _Chips_ are _dumped_ (played) into _pool_. A _pool_ is a _meet_ of _some_ _kind_/type. The pool is "mixed" in a sense, since games can be played to grab the information from all kinds of levels, and there is already a lot of _decision making_ going on. So in the pool, they mix/sort/cross(genetics)/meet. In a word, they _grow_. At each _step_, _each_ _peer_ _must_ _feel_ what is _best_. Then _make_ _move_. _Take_ _shot_. The _game_ of _feel_ is the use/take of _notes_ to interpret information in environment/home/boundary/side/face/hand. The _hands_(eyes/receptors/hands/senses) _find_/_grab_ (search phase in associative memory) _ships_ (locks/knob/ship/knot/ball/node/boss/head! in meet) from _meet_, and _saves_ as _notes_. These are _notes_. These _notes_ are maybe the _riches_ of the _peer_. So the _hands_ _find_ the _heads_ of the _meet_. So a _head_ of a _meet_ is a _leader_. The _lead_ of a _meet_. So the hands/posts/ports find the _leads_/heads(sales leads/project lead/leader/heads of teams/etc.) of a _meet_. A post/port/pick of a meet. A _pick_ of a _meet_. (haha, could make a poem showing how all of these words are related! so we can find just the right words for a base, walking from our current natural language down to these). So the _post_ is like just before, and a _pick_ is like the _tool_ during and after. But if you look at it at zero time, it is generically a _pick_. Once you start to _draw_ in out in _time_, _picks_ _turn_ _into_ _posts_ (lookouts for danger and opportunities, risk/reward, death/life, treasure). A _shot_ is your _chance_ to _beat_ a _game_. It is a _move_. Shots from you or from others == danger / opportunity. _Shots_ _fired_. (basketball shots, weapon shots, medicinal shots, etc.). A _room_ for a _move_. A shot is a room for a move. So basically, we're working with a _very_ _hard_(complex) _game_. hard/weak/soft. So we _work_ in a _very_ _hard_ _game_. Or we _live_ in a _very_ _good_ _room_. We _have_ a _good_ _home_. Or we _play_ a _foul_ _game_, and become _vile_/corrupt. It is all _based_ on a _peers_ _view_. Then the peers can _send_ their _message_. Can _share_ their _notes_. So that others can learn about their lives, to find a better compromise. Then it comes down to stories, and listening/_tuning_ _into_ the _message_. This is back to the _picks_/ports/shots. So messages have to be _received_. They have to be _wanted_. This is the _story_ or _plot_. This is how the peers play a more clever/_cool_ game. They get tricky, and clever and surprise. But some selfs real-ize (that is, they _take_ _note_ of). Some selfs take note of general pattern. wide/general thin/specific. Some peers take note of wide, and some of thin patterns. Some peers _take_ _wide_ _notes_, some _thin_. So this means, no path is better than the other, just as long as everyone is happy. Just as long as each _peer_ is _well_. Thus/then, take wide notes or thin notes. Each is the same. Each will move _well_ and _move_ _rude_. bad/course/rough/dry.Wet/dry good/bad. Loud/rude/sick/tart/sharp vs. soft/fine/well. Will be viewed as good or foul by peers. After _move_, _each_ _peer_ _will_ _feel_ their neighbors/bonds/links (the peers they are aware of) are _foul_ or _good_. After _each_ _move_, _each_ _peer_ _will_ _feel_ _their_ _bonds_ are either _foul_ or _good_. pick foul, pick good. `when move, each peer, will feel, with bonds, pick good, pick foul`. The _code_ is what you agree on. The _terms_ you _pick_. The _bonds_ are the _peers_ a _self_ _views_. In a game, maybe these are the _links_. This _means_ (are the) "people you know" that might have something good or bad to say about your _move_. This is your social network in a sense. But in a much more general sense than facebook. These are the "_factors_ in your decision". They are divided/grouped/chunked/typed into _parts_ (_view_ _parts_ from _bonds_). Some of these _parts_ are _cares_, else parts are _bores_. That is one _search strategy_. A technique/algorithm. A _tool_? A _plan_? You apply _plans_ to _sort_ _peers_ _into_ _parts_. Plans are saved notes to beat games. So you use _notes_ to beat game of sorting peers into parts. to beat a game where you sort peers into parts. to beat a game that sorts peers into parts. So you weight the pros and cons of decisions using knowledge (the _notes_ you _have_, the stuff you've written down). _Look_ at _loss_ and _gain_ (in future, to see the impact it will have). A _peer_ _looks_ at _loss_ and _gain_ _with_ _notes_. This itself is a game. So it's a recursive game. A game nest. Resolving each decision requires solving a game nest. _Each_ _pick_ _means_ a _peer_ _must_ _beat_ a _game_ _nest_. So/then/thus this is what each peer will make/deed/do with each step. _Each peer must beat some game nest each step_.
  +  (_based_ is relative assumption of peer?)
3. code (rules of deeds, terms of contract, law). 
  + term
  + deal

```coffee
when move
  each peer
    will feel
      with bonds
      pick good # either good
      pick foul # or bad
```

(Therefore, there seems to be a way to generate any natural english sentence from this! Therefore, it is the `wild tone` or the `wild text`.

```
wild text, Natural Language
```

So there is a meet of peers that play the game of life, with codes.

Everything else might just be elaborations on this. Even a seed, which is a meet of 2 peers, making a feat.

Since a meet is a peer at a different _size_ (scale), all meets are peers. They are called _meets_ because they appear as non-selfs to peers like humans. But this does not mean they aren't peers, it's just that they are simple/soft peers.

## Spans

The spans that have been named. These are all _types_ in a _self_. These are some of the ways that _peers_ _view_ the _song_ (the universe).

This is the _wisdom_ of the _sage_. The _realization_ of the _sameness_, of the _natural_ _way_.

- give/take
- weak/bold (coffee/beer/strength)
- good/foul: good leads to happiness of peers, foul leads to suffering
- cool/dumb: useful vs. not useful. span of usefulness
  - keen/weak: how capable a peer is in a meet (from peers perspective) (i think this might just be cool/dumb)
- glow/fade: view of self quickly focuses on similar/same peers
- care/bore: after view allows feel, care/bore is quality/rank of feel
- rich/poor: how much notes/information a peer holds
- calm/wild: rational, non rational, smooth/chaotic (rage?) (have control vs. lack control) not really aware
- base/head: front and back of self; start and end
- want/shun: a need is a specific type of want required for life
- this/that: close and far; self and other
- rise/fall: up and down
- help/hurt or help/harm
- gain/loss
- stay/move: use of information by peers; change (death/rest)
- push/pull
- dear/fool?
- free/tied free/sack
- fast/slow (cool/dumb?)
- hard/weak: weak/soft is easy/simple to use, hard is complex, not easy to use.
- wide/thin: wide/general thin/specific

Wet/dry good/bad. Loud/soft.

## Nouns

Everything is a self/peer, just depends on how you _view_ it.

All meets are selfs.

1. lead: _lead_ of a _meet_, the head of a meet. The _hands_(eyes/receptors/hands/senses) _find_/_grab_ (search phase in associative memory) _ships_ (locks/knob/ship/knot/ball/node/boss/head! in meet) from _meet_, and _saves_ as _notes_.
1. cell: a peer in a mesh (this is how music or biology or particles could be thought of). so tile/cube are 2d and 3d _cells_. so visualization and motion comes from cells.
1. name: identifying a self (what a peer _calls_ a peer)

1. rule: deal between peers? if you break rules you break deal, so maybe rule == deal?
1. term: token of exchange between peers (coin, money, words, customs, etc.), == agreement between peers == deal/rule?
1. pure: every deal was best in meet; (alt..?) a "simple" peer; therefore, easy to grok (understand): this is because if all deals were good, it would be easy for anyone to understand!
1. mesh: a _meet_ where _most_ _deals_ are _nice_. a _rich meet_. graph/lattice/general data structure for matrices, a "complex" peer. a mesh is a highly integrated meet. a _nice meet_.
1. tree: simplified data structure; subset of mesh; how peers grow
1. list: even simpler data structure, a flat data structure
1. spot: place in a mesh; a part of a mesh
1. site: a place in a meet; a part of a meet
1. past: past
1. news: present
1. fate: future
1. game: difference between two states? path to solve a problem
1. word: a promise of a peer. "word"(way of looking at it, a representation of a thing, an alternative representation of a thing, therefore, a promise?

1. tell: a sign of probability
1. come: to happen, to occur
1. sign: code of peer
1. dear: a friend of a peer (one that helps a peer); ally; ant. foe/fool?; a good host
1. fool: an enemy/foe? going against; a bad host
1. care: something important to a peer (care/bore)
1. bore: something not important to a peer
1. rank: quality of feel (high quality / rich quality is a good feel, rich rank)
1. keen: clever, capable ("can", skill, talent, etc.) (keen/weak)
1. weak: (bore?) not capable, not skilled (sick); prey
1. bold: predator (weak/bold, prey/predator)
1. calm: rational === good
1. face: what a peer feels/notes from other peers?
1. real: feat in view/perspective of peer

1. feat: the result of a deed, the product of a self (the "effect", the stored data in an associative memory inner product moore-pseudoinverse matrix)
1. view: _views_ are what a _peer_ sees from _else_. world a self is aware of; the perspective of a peer; each note a peer took in a meet
1. feel: the tools a peer can view of in a meet (direct experience, which is influenced by the view)
1. note: the _riches_ of a _peer_. the parts of the meet the self remembers, so sort of a filtering function; the "events" in an experience. A note is the raw information stored in memory. In a sense, a note is raw information in information theory. A _note_ is _pure_ _calm_, not _wild_, if it is _made_ from _fact_. A note is _part_ _calm_ if _some_ _notes_ are _myth_ (not _fact_).
1. plot: the story of a meet of peers
1. flow: movement of peers
1. jail: a 
1. host: tool of life
1. road: life path; current path you are walking on

1. turn: a deal made on a road; a change in a path; a choice to make at a step in a path. Your _turn_ is when you can _move_.
1. chip: chip away at goal, creating small products/tools: tool == product of deed. a `deed/chip`. a chip is _evidence_ of movement. it is the _result_ of a move. Imagine in a game, it is the _chip you lay down in the game for your next move_. This chip can then be used in building the next part of the game. Therefore: deed/chip == cause/effect

1. fact: view derivable from base (where the self starts from)
1. myth: view not derivable from base
1. base: without any inner knowledge
1. core: the terms holding a meet together ("principles"); so a core is a set of "important" rules, glowing rules.

1. body: the tool of a mind
1. task: a deed to be done; maybe task == deed
1. home: best spot
1. best: optimal solution
1. goal: future state, better world
1. ship: important information made by peer
1. post: lookout for harm
1. port: handler of ships; a _feel_ of ships? so a _meet_ of peers most generally

1. none: empty
1. span: a range of peers (scope of peers? limit)
1. band: a range of types of peers; or maybe band == span? or `span == full band`
1. type: a pattern of peers, of what they _look like_
1. look: a telling fate of a peer (a tell is a sign of a prediction, and fate is future, so what the self looks like in the future is a "look")

1. same: a same peer
1. else: a different peer
1. rich: high quality
1. poor: low quality

1. ship: 1d message? or line?
1. tile: 2d view
1. cube: 3d view
1. room: "space"
1. beat: rhythm of movement; "beat game" (as verb) is to move through the game to goal (though might not use it like that, b/c pass/fail is simpler; beat == pass game, depends on game type i guess; to "last" is to survive a game; to stay alive in the game)
1. last: to survive a game; to stay alive in the game; "to last in life"
1. mean: to assign meaning to a feel; the interpretation of information
1. call: how a mind references the body (body is more general than direct body, but body of all experience?) (verb or noun)

1. shun: to avoid; to move away
1. need: a want _pure_ly for life; a pure want for life (a want scoped to life)
1. hope
1. plan: saved/remembered ability to beat game. A _tool_? A _plan_? You apply _plans_ to _sort_ _peers_ _into_ _parts_. Plans are saved notes to beat games. So you use notes to beat game of sorting peers into parts.
1. link:
1. bond: The _bonds_ are the _peers_ a _self_ _views_. peers a peer is are aware of. this is a narrowing/focusing/thinning of _view_. A _bond_ is a _view_ of a _peer_. You can have _good_ _bonds_ and _foul_ _bonds_. _real_ bonds and _fake_ bonds. They can be real or fake whether or not you can _know_ their _intentions_. You have to know the other self. You have to know what they are capable of. So bonds are _real_ because of _some_ _fact_ a peer _knows_ of _else_ peer (another peer). _Bonds_ are _fake_ if _peer_ does not _know_ _fact_ of _else_, or if _peer_ does know facts/_views_, but _views_ are _myths_. _views_ are what a _peer_ sees from _else_. So a bond is an awareness of others. This is the "objects" we are aware of. Philosophers called these the things these bonds reference "objects". Which are in relation to a "subject". So subject and object have a relation. This is the basis of 20th century math before the rise of modern computer science. Once we became aware of computation, and started including that in our _thought_ _process_, our _models_ became more accurate.
1. loop: a repeat in a process?
1. safe: 
1. sort: an order to the peers in a meet

1. lack:
1. root:
1. bead:

1. zone: In the zone mean you're in a happy place. Where you no longer _feel_ your _self_. In a word, you are _calm_, yet taking _notes_.
1. keep:
1. well: A peer can _feel_ _well_. This means it's "happy". This is the ideal.
1. fine: a semi-pure peer; a "normal" peer. assume all peers are "fine" (normal)
1. knob: a part of a peer another peer can grab
1. mass: a mesh in a game of push and pull
1. cool: a _tool_ from the _news_ that is useful; a new useful tool. fashionable; impressive; setting an example; "fly"; new information that isn't needed but maybe wanted? Something cool is _useful_?
1. dumb: a new tool that is _not_ useful. Something dumb is not useful.
1. time: Time scale, or _time_ _size_, is the _size_/number of _steps_ to _beat_ a _game_ _nest_. how fast moves are made. therefore, time is relative. Time is a mesh.
1. size: scale/weight
1. wild
1. shot: A shot is a room for a move.
2. slot: a spot in a mesh.

A _feat_ or _make_ is an _effect_. "The make of the car". But changing it to describe the _result_ or _effect_ of the _action_, of the _deed_.

```
same feat, effect
same deed, action
```

Maybe _feat_ or _make_.

A feat is a deed that is done. So a deed is more general, it may or may not be done.

So a deed becomes a feat once done.

A _seed_ is the _feat_ of _mates_ (one or more?). So every tool(mind) => body is essentially a _mate_, the result of which is a _seed_. So a _deal_ is many peers (other selfs) agreeing upon which _seeds_ to _make_.

Therefore, cause/effect is mate/seed.

```
same cause, mate
same effect, seed
```

(a thing that doesn't make sense? or that has some thing that doesn't exactly match with the current thing!) so it's like a _myth_, a thing you know that should be different, but don't know how it should look. therefore, it is something _outside your mind_, outside what you _know_. Or outside what you know about the thing that is the _same_. So you have some knowledge of the _same_ thing given your _notes_. And something _different_ is something outside the notes you took about that thing. Something that is _else_ (other/foreign) to the notes. This is the _separating force_, the _separating game of push and pull_.

This means all natural language is a reflection of this. Which means that all of natural language could be derived from just these principles. Meaning this would be a theory of everything.

So same/else

---

git commit messages are bad b/c they interrupt your flow. you have to think about summarizing, which isn't always what you want to do. or maybe you should only commit when you are ready to go into summarizing mode. therefore, commit = summarize work = organize work = order work = sort work. (transform from song language to term language). so commit means you now _sort your work_. That is a process of _review_. It is going over what you have collected. It is _re-viewing your work_. It is a _loop to view work_.

A _loop to view work_, is then just part of it. You also want to simplify work, to make it easier to understand, to know. You want to _move_ the _notes_ around, to _move_ the _notes_ to different _spots_.

```
Song language = "natural" language. Term language = formal language.
```

Or maybe `wild language`! That is the uncontrolled version.

---

```
each (all)
either (any of all)
  part of each
  part/else
  turn in a game
  choice in turn of game.
```

Your _turn_ is when you can _move_. 

```
each/whole
part/either
```

## `note`

```coffee
to beat game of sorting peers into parts # more wild for humans, matches our mind best
to beat a game where you sort peers into parts # more calm/rational
to beat a game that sorts peers into parts # pure calm.
```

```
want each note, to be calm, not wild.
hope each note, is calm, not wild
```

Key principle in good game:

```coffee
good game
  hope each note, is calm, not wild
```

A _note_ is _pure_ _calm_, not _wild_, if it is _made_ from _fact_. A note is _part_ _calm_ if _some_ _notes_ are _myth_ (not _fact_).

```
part calm
sometimes calm
some time, is calm
```

```
and not
instead of
while
rather
over
else
```

```
means
are the
```

```coffee
note base # base assumption
  each peer, must beat, some(game nest), each step
```

Associative programming! This is the _computation_ that occurs in the universe. This is the fabric of _time_. Mesh of time. _Time_ is a _mesh_.

```
mesh time
```

This is the basic _block_ of _computation_. Basic _cell_ of _computation_. The basic _move_.

```coffee
fact move
  each peer
    must beat
      some game nest
      each step

when move
  each peer
    will feel
      with bonds
      pick good # either good
      pick foul # or bad
```

A note can be _fact_ or _myth_. If you don't know, you can say _note_, which is more general.

## `pick`

A _pick_ is a special kind of _deed_ (cause).

It is a basic _part_ of a _move_.

Each peer must beat some game nest each step.

A pick is a special kind of move. So pick is based on move.

```coffee
deed pick, base move
  where game, is life
```

```coffee
deed pick
  base move
    when game, is life
```

```coffee
deed pick, base move, when game, is life
```

A _pick_ is a _peer move_.

## `life`

_Life_ is a _stay_ in a _game_.

```coffee
fact life, is stay, in game
```

## `stay`

A _stay_ is a _hold_ where _life_ is ruled for a _peer_.

A _stay_ is a _hold_ on _life_, for a _peer_. You are in a sense, parking in a slot in a mesh.

## `spot`

A _spot_ is a _full_ _slot_ in a _mesh_?

By full, there is _data_ in the slot. There are chips added? Or seeds sewn?

## `hold`

A hold is the notes a peer takes. The _riches_ in a sense.

A hold is a mesh of notes. There are many times where a `containerobject`/mesh is a `collection`/meet.

```coffee
fact hold
  is note mesh
  of peer
```

```coffee
fact hold, is mesh, of notes
```

- of/for/with

```coffee
fact hold, is notes, made, from peer
```

## `text`

```
make text, from sign list
```

A `text` is a _list_ of _signs_. A _sign_ is a single character. A _sign_.

(note: this path really does seem to be leading to wisdom! i am currently experiencing a wider awareness of my life, how i am communicating with people like my fiance, i can catch myself more when i notice a particular type of situation (from a _tell_), which invokes certain _deeds_, etc.).

VARIATION SYNTAX:

```
text variation
  slot 1, to n
    text word
  containerobject/mesh/...
```

```coffee
text variation
  loop # a loop in a mesh, since a text is a "line" or "string" or "list" of "sign".
    span
      text letter
    slot
      text slash

  like # example, to verify at runtime.
    containerobject/mesh/...
```

## `sign`

A _sign_ is a single character. It is a cell in a mesh that is used as a code.

```coffee
fact sign
  a cell, in a mesh
    where used, as code
    where view cell, as code
```

A :sign is a :cell in a :mesh with :peers :that :view :cell as :code. It is the part of the mesh that the peer _can/might/may know_ wish.

```
A :sign is a :cell in a :mesh.
A [sign] is a [cell] in a [mesh].
```

## `span`

A `span` is a `slot from one to n`.

```
fact span
  a slot, from this, to they
```

```
from 1, to n
from this, to they
```

Unlike html, term lang has a formal definition.

## `slot`

```
fact slot, is free spot, in mesh
```

## `spot`

```
fact spot, is peer hold
  can be
  might be
  could be
  sell 
```

A _sell_ is a _hold_ that can _live_ in _future_. It is something you are trying to _give_ to _else_ for a _more_ _rich_ _life_. So might/could/can is really saying what _fate_ _will_ _sell_. The future/fate, will sell some possibilities.

A _spot_ is a place in a _meet_. Maybe this would be an assumption too? Or maybe it needs to be derived somehow.

```
fact spot
```

A spot is a cell.

Maybe spot/slot is a _peer_ _that_ _holds_. A _container_ a _cell_. A _holding_ _peer_. A spot is a hold of peers.

```
fact spot, is hold, of peers
```

```
fact spot, is peer hold
```

This implies there is a mechanism that will get you into the slot, and out of the slot. Which is cool, it's like how an associative memory process works.

## `fate`

The future.

```

```

Fate is the result/feat/seed of a deed?

```
deed
fate
```

Fate is the final result of a deed. So the seed, leads to an _ultimate_ _fate_.

The seed makes play. Play makes news. eventually, fate.

Seed is the _start_ of _some_ _game_ of _life_.
Fate is the _end_ of _some_ _game_ of _life_.

Deed is cause, seed is effect.
In this sense, this seed, is from, that fate.

```
note
  this seed, is from, that fate
```

So there is a _loop_ of _seed_ and _fate_. Birth and death.

```
birth/seed
death/fate
```

This is the _cycle_ of _birth_ and _death_ in the ancient religions.

So _fate_ is the _end_ of _life_ of _some_ _peer_.
Fate is _head_ of _life_ of _some_ _peer_. So it is _this_.

```
fact fate, is head, of life, of some peer
```

## `this`

```
make this, from fate
```

Now, or _this_, is the _seed_ of _fate_.

```
fact this, is seed, of fate
```

## `that`

_That_ is the _else_ of the _seed_ of _fate_.

```
fact that, is else, of seed, of fate
```

Could also say:

```
fact that, is else, of some fate
```

## `else`

Else is the _other_ of a peer in a meet. The else is all the peers outside of the self. Else is the peers that are not the self, in the _meet_ of _note_.

_Else_ is _peer_ _that_ are not _noted_ _peer_ in _mesh_. By _mesh_, maybe it's a _hold_. That makes more sense.

An _else_ is _each_ _peer_ not in _note_ of _hold_. Since a _hold_ is a _mesh_ of _peers_.

```
fact else
  each peer
    with meet
    hold them, in hold note (focus point)
      # except/save/minus/without/hold
      hold

```

## `mind`

A _mind_ is a _hold_ of _notes_. A _note hold_.

```
fact mind, is note hold
```

A :mind :holds :notes of a :body.

You can then extract/glean/feed/grab the _body_ the _notes_ _reference_ by _introspection_. This is how _self_ consciousness can work. Self consciousness is _self view_. A _peer_ has a _view_ of a _self_ in _mind_.

```
note self view
  when peer, holds view, of self, in mind
```

(This _note_ _turns_ _into_ _fact_, because it can be _derived_).

```
become/turn into/meet
```

A _note_ _meets_ _fact_ is a _note fact meet_, or a _proof_.

That is, a _fact_ is a _meet_ of _notes_ _with_ _base_.

A _view_ is a peers _consciousness_. A _view_ of a _self_, or _self view_ means _self conscious_.

```
self view
```

That is _self conscious_.

## `fact`

```
fact fact, is pair of base, and note
```

A _fact_ is a _meet_ of _notes_ _with_ _base_.

```
this fact, is meet, of notes, with base
this fact, is pair of base, and note
```

(If all _meets_ can be shown to be _meshes_, then you could say _all facts are meshes_!) That would mean all facts can be computed in an associative memory. A _good world_ would be provable or something.

## `pair`

A _pair_ is a _meet_ of _this_ and _that_. Which says, they must be distinct.

```
fact pair, is meet, of this, and that
```

## `save`

```
except/save/minus/without/hold
```

A _save_ is a _hold_.

## `sell`

```
fact sell, is hold, in fate
```

A _sell_ is a _hold_ that can _live_ in _future_. It is something you are trying to _give_ to _else_ for a _more_ _rich_ _life_. So might/could/can is really saying what _fate_ _will_ _sell_. The future/fate, will sell some possibilities.

A _sell_ is a _hold_ in _fate_.

```
might be
could be
can be
...
mean
  fate will sell look
```

## `look`

A _view_ of a _peer_ in _fate_. A _view_ from a future perspective.

```
fact look, is view, of peer, in fate
```

## `note`

note: the _riches_ of a _peer_. the parts of the meet the self remembers, so sort of a filtering function; the "events" in an experience. A note is the raw information stored in memory. In a sense, a note is raw information in information theory. A _note_ is _pure_ _calm_, not _wild_, if it is _made_ from _fact_. A note is _part_ _calm_ if _some_ _notes_ are _myth_ (not _fact_).

## `peer`

A peer we assume is a self. We call every pattern of information a self, that is the base assumption. We call it a _note_ because we don't know if it's true or not, but it _seems_ _like_ a _good_ _pick_.

```
seems like good pick
```

```coffee
base peer

# where self is peer from "this" view
make self, peer, from this view
make else, peer, from that view
```

## `move`

We also assume _motion_, or _change_, since we all experience the universe moving.

```coffee
base move
```

Then we define the move in a way that is general enough to be applied to any possible situation.

```coffee
fact move
  each peer
    must beat
      some game nest
      each step
```

## `meet`

A _meet_ is also at the _base_. A meet is one or more peers.

Since we assume the present of at least one peer, we automatically get the meet.

```coffee
fact meet, from peer
  because one # justification / fact tree
```

- justification of fact
- reasoning
- proof of fact
- tree of fact
- "fact tree"

(me iterating / narrowing down the definition until it _suits_ or _fits_ the _facts_).

"Definition" is the "meaning" or "feel" or "mean"? Maybe _mean_ == _feel_? No the _mean_ is the feel of a meet of selfs. It is a term in a code? So because of the _feel_ of the _term_ "peer" from the _sage_ _view_!

```coffee
fact meet, from peer
  from feel,
    with term peer
    from sage view
```

This is the structure of a _proof_ in this system! YAY! That is how it should be.

```coffee
fact meet
  from feel, of peer, of term peer
    from sage view
```

This _fact_ _tree_ is a mathematical proof. It's the _limb_ of a _fact_. The _limb_ of a _note_. The _link_ of a _note_. The _bond_ of a _fact_. This _bond_ is like a chain reaction of rules/deals/facts.

## `feel`

depends on peer and pick

A feel is what a peer picks from else.

A _feel_ is a _note take_.

```
make feel, from note take
```

## `view`

_views_ are what a _peer_ sees from _else_?

each note a peer took in a meet

```
fact view
```

Note is the effect/result of saving feel. So the view is the note that is used by a peer to feel?

## `bond`

The _bonds_ are the _peers_ a _self_ _views_.

## `chip`

_When_ a _chip_ is _played_, the _game_ _changes_. The game keeps changing. That is, the game _grows_. A _chip_ _makes_ the _game_ _grow_. A _seed_ _makes_ the _game_ _grow_.

A _seed_ _makes_ _life_ _grow_.
A chip makes life grow.

```coffee
fact chip
  will make life grow
```

```
makes life grow
will make life grow
```

It can either _help_ or _hurt_. It can either mean(interpretation) _gain_ or _loss_. That is, _each_ _peer_ _will_ _feel_ _good_ or _foul_. Because _chips_ are the _seed_ of _deed_.

```
deed (cause)
seed (effect)
```

## `deed`

A _deed_ is a _play_ of _seed_. Like a throw of die, or a _flip_ of _coin_. There is, a flip of coin! That is the basis of probability!! Woop.

```
woop
yeah
nope
```

```
fact deed, is play, of seed
```

```
fact deed, is play, of game
```

```
fact deed, is game play
```

## `seed`

```
fact seed, is base, of life
fact seed, is food, of life
```

Seed is the _base_ of _life_. The _base_ is of a _mesh_? Not sure about base yet, but I think I had it earlier.

The _base_ is almost the _food_? The _food_ is what you can _use_ to _live_. In that sense, the _base_ is the _food_?

```
fact seed, is food, of peer
```

Therefore, predation and _prey_ relations!

```
boss/prey
buff/prey
bold/prey
```

A _tax_, a _fine_, a _cost_. For co-interaction? Privileges over the others.

So there's _weak_ and _bold_ _peers_. _Predator_ and _prey_!

```
make bold, be peer, with more
make bold, hold peer, with more
```

Use _hold_ to show putting into _slot_ in _hold_ (mesh of notes).

```coffee
make bold, hold peer, with more
make weak, hold peer, with less
```

This in a sense creates a _term_ for a _type_.

```coffee
term bold, hold peer, with more
term weak, hold peer, with less
```

This basically means that we need to fight for what we want! So crazy.

## `food`

```
fact food, is base, of life
```

Food is what _allows_ or _lets_ life/peers live.

## `life`

Life is the _flow_ of _seed_.

```
fact life, is flow, of seed
```

Since the _base_ of the _main_ _song_ is _peer_, a _flow_ is _over_/of/with/in a _mesh_.

## `flow`

A flow is a move of a mesh (a nice meet). A flow is a move of a meet.

```
fact flow, is move, of meet
```

? not totally sure.

```
fact :name, is :verb, of :noun
fact :name, is :noun, of :noun
```

These objects are both verbs and nouns, depending on the _view_ (view/angle/perspective).

## `mesh`

```
fact mesh, is nice meet
```

## `grow`

A _seed_ _makes_ _life_ _grow_.

```
deed seed, grow life
```

The deed of a seed is to grow life.

Not sure if that's right.

## `with`

A _with_ is a _part_ of a _peer_.

```
fact with, is part, of peer
```

Maybe a _with_ is a _part_ of a _peer_ from the _view_ of an _else_!

```
note with
```

(by writing `note` like that, editor will try to parse/compile/know/see/feel code, and verify it's correctness. (just did a drill down into the exact word, so their must be a mental map in my head of how i'm navigating those words, which means there is a way to map wild text to calm text)).

```
make with, from meet part
make with, from peer part
```

## `know`

```
note know
  make calm(text), from wild text
```

To _know_ is to _think_. To _put_/place the wild text into the hold

```
note know
  make code, calm, from wild
```

```
note know
  with code
    when wild, make calm
```

```
note know
  when code
    when wild, make calm
```

To _grind_ maybe, to refine the wild into the calm. To _rasp_, or to _mill_. That's what it is!! Holy crap.

```
crap
```

To know is to _mill_. To _mill_ the _seed_.

```
deed know, deed mill, seed
```

Like _panning_ for _gold_. Like _filtering_ the _signal_.

## `like`

```
like panning, for gold # near same
```

A _like_ is a _near_ _same_.

```
fact like, is near same
```

## `same`

Identical, they cannot be telled apart. _This _means_, from the _view_ of a _self, _this_, is a _copy_ of _that_. A _copy_ is a _same_. A _same_ is a _copy_, same word.

A _same_ is a _view_ of a _self_, when _this_, is _that_.

```
fact same, is view, of self, when this, is that
```

What is an _is_?

An is is when there a _pair_ of _peers_ _turn_ _into_ one _peer_.

An _is_ is when a _pair_ _appears_ as _one_.

This is "equality" in typical math. But much richer.

An _is_ is a _view_ of a _pair_ as _one_ _name_. One peer.

Call two peers with one name.

An _is_ is a _name_. It is a _call_.

```
note same
  call view, from self, when this, mean that
```

A _note_ will be _automatically verified_ if it is a _fact_.

What is a _when_? A _when_ is a _case_.

```
note same, call view, from self, case this, mean that
note same, name view, base self, case this, mean that
```

Whoa, that's straight up proof haha, yay.

```
note same, call view, base self, case this, mean that
```

```coffee
note same
  call view
  base self
  case this
  mean that
```

## `case`

A _case_ is a _mesh_ from _mind_. A _case_ is a _tool_ in _mind_.

```
make case, call tool, from mind
```

## `make`

A _make_ is a _change_ in _mind_? A _make_ is a _step_ of _mind_. To _make_ is to _use_ _mind_ to _cause effect_. To _make_ is to _use mind_ to _deed seed_.

A _make_ is a _mind_ _used_ _seed_.

A _make_ is where a _deed_ is _from_ _mind_, and _seed_ is _from_ _that_ (everything outside of this current temporary self).

A _make_ is a _deed_ from _mind_ and a _seed_ from _body_.
A _make_ is _pair deed(mind),seed(body).

```
note make, call pair deed(mind), seed(body)
```

Where the _body_ is not from the _deed(mind)_, which is a separate self from seed(body).

## `call`

A _call_ is a _name_ a _self_ _notes_ for a _peer_ in a _meet_.

(it seems like meet is the same as a mesh, but i'm visualizing mesh way more visually, but it doesn't make 100% sense yet).

A _call_ is a _name_ a _self_ _saves_/_holds_ in _mind_ for a _feel_ of a _peer_ in a _meet_.

```
fact call, is name, a self will hold, in mind, when feel, a peer, in meet
```

A _call_ is a _name_, for a _feel_, of _peer_.

```
fact call, is name, for feel, of peer
```

What is a _feel_ of a _peer_? A _read_. It is an _impression_!

A _call_ is a _name_, for a _read_! YAY!

```coffee
fact call, is name, for read
```

```
call/be/is/exists/name
```

(Basically that notation is like _navigating_ the _mesh_, nice!). That's how easy it will be, just type words, _just_ _move_ _words_.

A _just_ is _only_ what you have to do. It is the minimal goal you have to reach.

```
just/most
```

A _just_ is a _soft_ _goal_. A _just_ is a _weak_ _goal_.

```
note just, call soft goal
```

```
note just, call weak goal
```

## `weak`

A _weak_ _goal_, is a _view_ of a _goal_ from a _peer_, where...

An _obvious_ goal.

- weak/obvious/bright/loud/easy/light/glow

(So it's easy. Hmm, making me wonder more about astrology now, kinda want to check it out haha, never really read about :)). But now it may have a clear explanation related to the minds of the peers.

## `bold`

A _bold_ _goal_ is a _view of a _goal_ from a _team_.

A _bold_ _goal_ is a _view of a _goal_ from a _team_, where _goal_ leads to good, or is hard, or many can't quite see.

- bold/not obvious/hard/dim/fade

A _bold_ _goal_ is a _goal_ that a _team_ _commits_ to, that _offense_/others/audience.

```
audience/crowd/host/herd/gang/mass
```

When the _host_. Or the _herd_.

A _bold_ _goal_ is a _goal_ a _team_ _plan_ with _does_.

A bold goal, call goal, with self, when else, skip note.

```
ignore/skip
```

```
note bold goal
  call goal, with self, when else, skip note
```

You can almost view these _steps_ as a _move_ though _space_. A _move_ through _game_. A _game_ is a _space_. A _game_ is a _room_ for _life_.

## `game`

A _game_ is a _room_ for _life_.

```
note game, call room, case life
```

## `for`

A _for_, is a _case_.

A _for_ is a _since_. Maybe like a _sent_. It is a _sent_. A _for_ is a _sent_ that is _provided_, or _given_ from _fate_.

(note: this walking through the transformation is really important. it should not be forgotten. but maybe it should also be easy to remember. so should go back through to _simplify_ and _standardize_ _knowledge_, or _clarify_ _notes_, or ...)

```
lick
cast
dash
hint
suit
work
neat
```

## `neat`

To _neaten_ _notes_, to _make_ a _neat_. A _neat_ is different from a _nest_. A _nest_ is automatic, but a _neat_ isn't.

A _neat_ is a _made_ _nest_. A _made_ is like a _done_.

A _neat_ is like a made bed, or folded socks.

```
note neat, call done nest
```

There is no more work that needs to be done in a _neat_.

```
whack/beat/kill
```

(in game contest, in _war_, in a _feud_).

## `gone`

A _gone_ is a _lack_ of _done_. It is a _lost_ _seed_. It is an extinct animal. It is a loss. A _gone_ is a _permanent_ loss.

A _gone_ is a _long_ _loss_.

```
note gone, call long loss
```

## `loss`

A _lack_ of what _was_. Something like that... getting late and tired.

## `temp`

A _temp_ is a _short_ thing. A _temp_ is _loss_ kept in fate. Something that we can see returning from fate. Where we find in fate. meet in fate.

A _temp_ is a _pair_ of a _loss_ and a _gain_ in _fate_.

```
note temp, call pair loss, gain from fate
```

## `long`

A _long_ _time_ is a _permanent_ _time_. It is a _time_ outside our imagination. It is a _far_ _place_. It is outside, or _past_ our _view_ of _fate_.

A _long_ is a _gift_ of _fate_ the _mind_ _lacks_.

```

(
The difference between these two:

```
a by is a thing near an else
note by, is thing near else
```

is that the first is easy to read, the latter hard to read. the former is harder to _deeply_ _know_, the latter is _easy to deeply know_. so it is based on a _trade off_.

**So there is a map from _easy to read, but hard to know_ to _hard to read, but easy to know_. The second is for _developers_, the first is for _consumers_.**

So you transform the easy into the hard in order to deeply know.

## `deep`

Maybe this means, _they_ _cant_ _stand_ _to_ _be_ _alone_.

They _dont_ have _ability_ _to_ _be_ _alone_.

Yet they are not _fully together_.

This means, part of them must be _left out of the atom_. Part of the particles must be left out of the atom.
