How can you take the other persons perspective into account and still be yourself?

My world should include their world.

How do you have an identity? You can be different people in different moments.

Identity: what others assign to you, and what you assign to your self. You have to be aware of your experience to do that.

Identity is the model of your self. So identity changes moment to moment.

My _normal world_ is merged with their world. Standard world, different worlds. So each individual has an array of worlds to switch between. These are called "contexts" in daily life.
