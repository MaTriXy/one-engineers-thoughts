# On the Computability of Information Structures

Time is the execution of computation, and space is a set of units of computation.

> time itself must pass slower in the stronger gravitational field relative to the weaker gravitational field. http://www.quora.com/How-can-gravity-affect-time

> moving away from source of gravity, time speeds up
> jupiter clock will tick slower than on earth

> A computation uses the evolution of a physical system to model an abstract theory. https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/when-does-the-universe-compute-7e8b1b0212fe
