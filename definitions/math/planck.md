Planck mass is thought to be weight of smallest black hole. Because a black hole that weighs less than the planck mass has less than 1 bit of information in it.

Planck time is the lifetime of such a black hole. How long for black hole to evaporate into radiation.

Planck area is the area of the horizon of such a black hole.

Key notion in quantum information theory is entanglement.

Pieces coming together to quantize gravity:

- Thermodynamics
- quantum mechanics
- entanglement
- information theory
- gravity (general relativity)

Boltzman constant relates entropy with information.

When you smash two particles together at high enough energy, we think we know exactly what happens. A black hole forms.

Schwartzchild radius of a black hole is basically a measure of the radius of the event horizon.

half width * newton's constant divided by the sqrt of the speed of light

Photons (hawking radiation) comes out of the black hole.

"complexity, information, and entanglement"

We are living now in the age of entanglement. Going to be the central ingredient of understanding gravity.

? What links two regions of space (two systems) ?

The closer they are, the more entangled they are. The further, the less entangled.

A system can be labeled by a complete set of observables (the "state"): |a>
That's called a "description of the state of a system".
Describe the combined system by |a b>. (tensor product of two systems)

> So the new thinking is describe the universe as a series of instantaneous snapshots on the relationship between objects. https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/the-question-that-could-unite-quantum-theory-with-general-relativity-ef4f3932c0b0

> A Top Quark is over 10 orders of magnitude larger than a Plank length. http://www.quora.com/How-does-the-size-of-a-quark-compare-to-the-planck-length

Neutrino ~10^-24m.
Quarks ~10^-{20-18}m.
upper bound on electron radius: 10âˆ’18m
