An observation is the acquisition of information from an information source.

A phenomenon is an "observable occurence". Basically this is saying that it's information that we can observe.

An information source is a source of information.

An observation can `support` or `refute` a model.

```
support
refute
```

```
agree
disagree
```

A model can be said to be correct if:

1. The model is supported by observations. You can observe these properties in the model.
2. Themodel is not refuted by observations. You can't observe properties that are in conflict with the model.

From reactive systems book.

Experience is more general than observation. An observation is a special type of experience, where you have an area of focus, a subset of the world that you have prioritized to interpret.
