A symbol is a representation of information.

A symbol is a representation of a piece of information?
A symbol is a representation of an observation.

Symbols have meaning.

The context of a symbol may change its meaning.

> A symbol is an energy evoking, and directing, agent

Maybe "symbol" and "model" have a similar relation like "pattern", "structure", and "object". In the end there would just be sort of:

model (formal version of symbol)

symbol -> model

informal -> formal
abstract -> more specific
level of abstraction?

a symbol is like a piece of a model, so on a scale of complexity

a model is more comprehensive.

A signal is a simple symbol.
A model is a formal symbol.

> A sign is anything that stands for something else.
> Context helps define the specific meaning of a sign.

> A symbol is different from a metaphor in that a symbol is used more consistently and widely than a metaphor.

> The other major semiotic theory developed by C. S. Peirce defines the sign as a triadic relation as "something that stands for something, to someone in some capacity"[1] This means that a sign is a relation between the sign vehicle (the specific physical form of the sign), a sign object (the aspect of the world that the sign carries meaning about) and an interpretant (the meaning of the sign as understood by an interpreter). According to Peirce signs can be divided by the type of relation that holds the sign relation together as either icons, indices or symbols. Icons are those signs that signify by means of similarity between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a portrait, or a map), indices are those that signify by means of a direct relation of contiguity or causality between sign vehicle and sign object (e.g. a symptom), and symbols are those that signify through a law or arbitrary social convention.

> In semiotics, a sign is something that can be interpreted as having a meaning, which is something other than itself, and which is therefore able to communicate information to the one interpreting or decoding the sign. 

> Signs can work through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory or taste, and their meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition.

> There are two major theories about the way in which signs acquire the ability to transfer information.

> A famous thesis by Saussure states that the relationship between a sign and the real-world thing it denotes is an arbitrary one. There is not a natural relationship between a word and the object it refers to, nor is there a causal relationship between the inherent properties of the object and the nature of the sign used to denote it.

> Pierce characterized the sign as the means to understanding. He counted as symbols all terms, propositions, and arguments whose interpretation is based upon convention or habit, even apart from their expression in particular languages. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs". He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs,[7] that all thought has the form of inference (even when not conscious and deliberate),[7] and that, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.[8] The result is a theory not of language in particular, but rather of the production of meaning, and it rejects the idea of a static relationship between a sign and that which it represents, its object. Peirce believed that signs are meaningful through recursive relationships that arise in sets of three.

> A sign is something which depends on an object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) an interpretation, an interpretant, to depend on the object as the sign depends on the object. The interpretant, then, is a further sign of the object, and thus enables and determines still further interpretations, further interpretant signs. The process, called semiosis, is irreducibly triadic, Peirce held, and is logically structured to perpetuate itself. It is what defines sign, object, and interpretant in general.

> Sign (or representamen[13]): that which represents the denoted object (cf. Saussure's "signifier").
Object (or semiotic object): that which the sign represents (or as some put it, encodes).

So in this sense, there is just information. The mind then can store the information so that it can be used later. The relationship between the original information and the information in the mind is "object" to "sign". So an object is information a mind has created a sign for.

> Interpretant (or interpretant sign): a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a further sign by interpreting (or, as some put it, decoding) the sign. (through recursion)

> semiosis is sign process

The term was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of sign relations, or semiotics.

> Semiosis is triadic and cyclic.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiosis

> Semiosis or semeiosis is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs.

A sign is part of a process of relation between agent and world

> Extending the analysis presented by Zlatev (2003), where meaning was defined
as “the relationship between an organism and its environment, determined by [...]
value” (ibid: 258) the concept of meaning in the present theory presupposes (a)
subject S, (b) a subject-internal value system V and (c) a world in which the subject
(as being-in-the-world) is embedded, W

> Peirce explained that signs mediate between their objects and their interpretants in semiosis, the triadic process of determination
