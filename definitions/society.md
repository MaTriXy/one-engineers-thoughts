- Monarchy: Freedom limited to kings and court
- Society: Freedom limited to socialites, who can win favor and carry the torch of the "investors"
- Problem Solving Network (PSN, need better word haha): Freedom is much more available because you don't have to try to play the political/social games to win favor of the investors. You have investment to live a wonderful life and participate in the PSN, "community of intelligence", or "intelligent force". Need better word than those, but alternative to "society", which is about groups. But we shouldn't be focusing on the fact that these are groups, it should be more general than that.
