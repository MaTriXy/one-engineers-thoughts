You can expand on that an say, a story is an encoded message shared between individuals to gain experience.

A story guides an intelligent agent through an experience, to learn the knowledge so they are capable of deciding which action to take in that experience when it comes up for them. Instead of telling them which action to take, we should tell them through a story. It's basically self learning instead of teacher learning.

Stories can occur at all levels of information. So a cell could perhaps tell another cell a story. Really this is saying, one cell passes a set of signals to another cell, first by knowing the experience of the other cell, and knowing the actions they would like to perform, and then sharing that information with it, so it is capable of the action. Maybe it doesn't have the intention aspect, but it seems like it may be possible to some degree.

This is why you can ask, "what is the story of the amazon rainforest?", and the deepest way to know would be to actually _be_ the amazon rainforest, but short of that, a description of how it came to be would be useful.

Stories can be _unconscious_. This is because consciousness is the awareness of experience, so experience can be below consciousness. "What stories to we subconsciously tell ourselves?"
