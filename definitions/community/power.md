> power is the ability to influence or control the behavior of people.

Having powers means you can limit or allow people to execute certain actions. You can control other's actions.

> The term "authority" is often used for power perceived as legitimate by the social structure.

Influence is one use of power. But power can come in other forms too.

Power is the ability to control action.

> Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less empathy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_control
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power

Voting power, the ability to control the _outcome_ of a situation. So not necessarily the action, but the change it creates.

> Dominance hierarchy arises when members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. In social living groups, members are likely to compete for access to limited resources and mating opportunities. Rather than fight each time they meet, relative relationships are formed between members of the same sex. These repetitive interactions lead to the creation of a social order that is subject to change each time a dominant animal is challenged by a subordinate one.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy

Because it's more efficient like that! Not to fight the same person over and over, to get limited resources. But what happens when resources are no longer limited?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory

> Game theory is the study of strategic decision making.

> Specifically, it is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."

> Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and the ESS to explain the emergence of animal communication.

> This can be explained further by looking at the example of the common shrews. If one participant believes he is the resident of the territory, he will win when the opponent is weaker or food is scarce. However, if both shrews believe they are the true territory holder, the one with the greater need for food, and therefore, one that values the resource more, is most likely to win....the costs incurred to the defeated, which include loss of reproductive opportunities and quality food, can hinder the individual’s fitness. In order minimize these losses, animals generally retreat from fighting or displaying fighting ability unless there are obvious cues indicating victory

>  In wintering bird flocks, white-crowned sparrows display a unique white plumage; the higher the percentage of the crown that consists of white feathers, the higher the status of the individual.[4] For other animals, the time spent in the group serves as a determinant of dominance status. Pack members of gray wolves, for example, need the time to reach the top of the ladder. In great tits and pied flycatchers, high-ranking individuals experience higher resting metabolic rates and therefore need to consume more food in order to maintain fitness and activity levels compared to subordinates in their groups.

"high rank"

> These occasional mating opportunities available to subordinates reduce the likelihood of subordinates challenging the dominant male - mating is no longer an all-or-nothing game and the scraps are enough to placate most subordinates. In populations of Kenyan vervets, high-ranking females have higher foraging success when the food resources are clumped, but when food is distributed throughout an area they lose their advantage because subordinate females can acquire food with less risk of encountering a dominant female.[6]
> Among brown hyenas, subordinate females have less opportunity to rear young in the communal den, and thus had decreased survival of offspring when compared to high-ranking individuals. Subordinate males have far less copulations with females compared to the high-ranking males.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_hierarchy#Reverse_dominance_hierarchy

> To account for this fact, an anthropologist at UCLA named Christopher Boehm proposed a couple of years ago the idea of a reverse dominance hierarchy. The gist of his idea is that a love of dominance was so bred into the human species (males above all) during their long, shared hominid past, that they developed an innate distaste of being dominated by others. Thus armed with a motive, and using the cooperative skills which language and their big brains conferred upon them, all the lesser males in a group who were in danger of being dominated by an alpha male, would form a ‘reverse dominance hierarchy’ to put the would-be tyrant in his place. In this way, dominance behavior, while not eliminated entirely, could be moderated and dispersed. 

> all men seek to rule, but if they cannot, they seek to be equal

>  For example, !Kung bushmen will mock the gift of someone, because they see gift giving as an attempt to signal superior status. In effect, they ridicule this act because they see it as a pretext (clever bushmen!). In more complex societies, groups of men actually kill the upstart for a crime conveniently determined. Thus, egalitarianism is an implication of this aversion to strong rulers. 

Figure out ways to prevent dominance, and others figure out how to be dominant. Game to play.

> So much political punditry is a farce because all these policy wonks parse the words of politicians as if they were The Oracle at Delphi. Any real depth in these remarks is like reading one's anxieties into inkblots. If you read the text of any politician, the main feature is its blandness, the smarmy, recycled clichés that allow listeners to believe it means whatever they want it to. The president of the US, like the president of your senior class, or the general secretary of the UN, is someone chosen for his malleability and his simultaneous ability to appear non-malleable, as if we want him to be smart sounding but not smart. It's tolerable once you realize its comical.

We experienced for so many millions of years the dominance hierarchy and disliked it so much that we evolved/learned ways to prevent people from becoming dominant. So one of the goals we have is to prevent dominance, because we dislike it, because it prevents us from solving problems like eating or having access to resources.

Band societies formed before tribes.

> tribes organize links between families (including clans and lineages)

bands -> clans -> tribes

Plato describes why states are bad - http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/10/plato-explains-tyrants-arise/

Love of honor becomes the love of money. They yield to avarice and covetousness

> an insider clique, a ruling class, called an "OLIGARCHY." These are LOVERS OF 'MONEY' and 'GAIN.'

Plato's predicted government would go from:
Aristocracy - rule of the capable and virtuous; to
Timocracy - rule of the famous who love to be honored; to
Oligarchy - rule by a cliché of insiders; to
Democracy - rule by the people, but without virtue and self-control this ends in chaos;
out of which a Tyrant would arise.

- rule of capable and virtuous
  + the most capable ones run the system, this is the most efficient way to evolve, because it is run by the most capable ones
- rule of the famous who love to be honored
  + the capable ones start valuing the wrong things (create the wrong solutions, the first major wrong solution to the general efficient evolution of intelligence)
  + value famous people
- rule of group of insiders, the few famous people that don't know how to deal with this complexity, they distribute the honor and fame amongs each other, but nobody else
- rule by the people, but without virtue and self-control, ends in chaos
- out of which a tyrant arises

Therefore, we need to get back to rule by the capable. Software development is our chance for this. Open source development and peer to peer networks are a solution to this. But we have to figure out how to transition an entire democracy into a rule by the capable/virtuous. How to go from democracy -> aristocracy. Need a way to teach them all that is known, and have to keep everybody in the know about the information, at least enough to understand the benefits of a capable-run society. So that's the minimum knowledge to transform a human in a democry to a human in an aristocracy.

> Aristocracy...whom we rightly call just and good.

> A ruler considers...always what is for the interest of his subject...and that alone he considers in everything which he says and does.

> A state is an organized political community living under a single system of government.

A state is a group of intelligent agents with a government.

A government

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government

> A government is the system by which a state or community is controlled

This means it is the laws of action, the rules of action. It says which actions are allowed, and which actions are virtuous. It's the rules defining the best and worst actions to take in a group of intelligent agents.

```
definition government
  The rules defining the best and worst actions to take in a group of intelligent agents.
```

- if you're an honored famous person, then you should value money, the ideal
- if you value money then you should value power, the ideal

```
definition government
  The rules defining the forward and backward actions to take in a group of intelligent agents.
```

forward/backward, upward/downward actions to take in a group of intelligent agents. Up/down, because that is becomming better or worse, but up/down means intelligence is more efficiently solving problems of all intelligent structures, instead of less.

```
definition state
  A set of rules of actions for intelligent agents
```

```
In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority
```

So no state means no government. A state is a government plus the physical territory.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_society

> most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently-held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small

> While stateless societies were probably the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state. In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power. Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.
