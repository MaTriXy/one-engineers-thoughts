> Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money, trade, debt, bankruptcy, the criminality of theft, and private vs. public property.

Theft is a problem because it causes problems for you. However, you may not need that thing. If you simply can use it whenever you'd like, then you don't need to own it. Theft makes it look like you are out of control to others, so it's embarrassing too.

So it's almost like "crimes" are where you cause unnecessary problems.

Not having private property means it's hard to solve other problems in life, and to be productive. But it's not really the need for owned private property in itself. This too is just a means to an end (the ability to effectively solve problems). As long as you had a place were you could be alone whenever you desired, that is enough. And you had a place where you could sleep and eat and shower. That is enough. Nobody needs to own any of these things.

  The Structure of Ownership and the Theory of the Firm
  Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure

The state owning land to prevent destruction of national parks, for example, is a crude way of preventing people from performing harmful actions which will affect the environment, affect research, and all that other stuff. It's hard to prevent people from doing that without tools of observation. So ownership and laws preventing usage are a way around that.
