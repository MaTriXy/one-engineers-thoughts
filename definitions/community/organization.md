> has a collective goal

An organization is a group of people with a goal. A community is a group of people with values.

Values are general goals. In that sense communities and organizations are just types of groups.

The question is, can we have a system that automatically manages what goals we should have as a universe? What is the goal of the universe?

If the universe doesn't innately have a purpose, how do we define our purpose?
