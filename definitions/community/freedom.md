> Freedom, or liberty, is the power or right to do as one wants.

Freedom of gay marriage. This can cause problems for people that disagree. So how is that problem resolved? That is a problem with understanding. They need to be educated, and learn how to not limit other's freedoms. Their reaction to the freedom of others is their problem, not the person's problem. But how to show this clearly? You can't say well "your reaction to seeing someone killed is your problem". That is incorrect, because killing is already a harm that has been prevented by law for other reasons (it prevents others from solving problems). So you can't apply that reasoning here.

Humans have bodies that have randomly evolved to their current status. By nature they are problem solving agents, with certain drives, and experiences that produce pleasure and pain. Given these constraints, create a civilization or society or world such that the pleasures, pains, and problem solving are all in balance. Too much pleasure means no problem solving, and taking too many resources from the earth, or limiting others (slavery, monarchy). Too much pain means it's too hard to solve certain problems. So there is this balance.
