We keep certain things private like our bodies, because it creates emotions in others that is hard to control, and their sexual reactions prevents others from efficiently solving other problems. We want to prevent the things that prevent us from solving problems efficiently.

Privacy is needed to protect unnecessary _harm_. Harm being preventing users from solving problems efficiently. If you have no money, then you can't solve problems.

Trade secrets allow businesses to have an economic advantage. Meaning that they can control the world to a greater extent than others. We should not allow others to have an unbounded ability to control the world.

> The purpose of classification is to protect information. Higher classifications protect information that might endanger national security.

So classified information is to protect us from war (physical harm) with other nations. This is a bigger problem. Inflicting harm on others prevents them from solving problems, which as we've defined is a bad thing. So classifying information is one method. But classifying information is not inherently necessary. It is just a means to an end, preventing us from being able to efficiently solve problems (keep our current standards of freedom, our economic position, etc.)

Classified information can be abused. Since any form of information secrecy can be used to control what happens in the world, organizations collecting classified information can control the world to a greater extent. The fear is that they will begin controlling us in undesirable ways. (preventing us from solving problems).
