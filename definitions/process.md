> In physics Ilya Prigogine[2] distinguishes between the "physics of being" and the "physics of becoming".

> Process thought describes truth as "movement" in and through substance.

> Since Whitehead, process thought is distinguished from Hegel in that it describes entities which arise or coalesce in becoming, rather than being simply dialectically determined from prior posited determinates. These entities are referred to as complexes of occasions of experience.

> Creativity is a **term coined by Whitehead** to show a force in the universe that allows the presence of an actual entity, a new actual entity, and multiple actual entities.
