The universe that we got is one in which information is _gained_, rather than _lost_. See individual.js readme.

> At its most fundamental, information is any propagation of cause and effect within a system. Information is conveyed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation of some thing. That which is perceived can be construed as a message in its own right, and in that sense, information is always conveyed as the content of a message.

> Information resolves uncertainty.

An observation is the acquisition of information from an information source.

A phenomenon is an "observable occurence". Basically this is saying that it's information that we can observe.

An information source is a source of information.

If an information source is information itself, how are they different? It's like an entity is an information structure. An artifact or something.

It's like an "artifact" is an easily recognizable information structure.

By easy, it is a fast operation.

An artifact is an information structure.
An object is an information structure.

What are the "pieces of information"?

> Information is any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns.

The universe is information. It's in formation.

> Gregory Bateson defines "information" as a "difference that makes a difference".

Information is the opposite of entropy?

> Information must not be confused with meaning.

> The mathematical universe hypothesis suggests a new paradigm, in which virtually everything, from particles and fields, through biological entities and consciousness, to the multiverse itself, could be described by mathematical patterns of information.

> Sources are **objects** which encode message data and transmit the information, via a channel, to one or more observers (or receivers)

> Any process that generates successive messages can be considered a source of information.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory#Source_theory

Information is the propagation of cause and effect within a universe.

> The main concepts of information theory are, first, that a "message" conveys a quantifiable amount of information to the recipient, and, second, that a "channel" (over which messages are transmitted) has a quantifiable information "capacity" defining the limiting rate at which it can convey information.

> To me replacing matter and energy with information is not helpful. But to physicists apparently it is not only helpful but something splendid.

> Algorithmic information theory is a subfield of information theory and computer science that concerns itself with the relationship between computation and information.

> Information is classically defined as reduction of uncertainty when a particular outcome occurs out of a repertoire of alternative outcomes: the more numerous the outcomes, the greater the reduction of uncertainty, and thus the information.

Information is the reduction of uncertainty.

Information is always interpretted from bottom up.

So once there is enough information at one layer, the next layer can interpret it.

So higher level patterns are always interpretting lower-level information/patterns. This means, information is generated from lower-levels, and slowly used to construct an awareness at a higher level.
