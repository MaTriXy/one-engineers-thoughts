StackOverflow is just a collection of problems and solutions. You could build a crawler to understand and build a mental model of all the problems and solutions. Then it organizes those into tutorials and examples.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_finding

> Five of the most common processes and factors that researchers have identified as barriers to problem solving are confirmation bias, mental set, functional fixedness, unnecessary constraints, and irrelevant information.

> mental set describes one's inclination to attempt to solve problems in such a way that has proved successful in previous experiences.

> the mental set created by expertise could lead to the development of fixation.

- avoid functional fixedness

There is always an answer in coding, the question is just how to find it.

Problem of understanding information changes when you text vs. verbal vs visual.

part of algorithm:

- identify irrelevant information

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubleshooting

> Troubleshooting requires identification of the malfunction(s) or symptoms within a system. Then, experience is commonly used to generate possible causes of the symptoms.

> Any unexpected or undesirable behavior is a symptom.

> Troubleshooting is the process of isolating the specific cause or causes of the symptom.

You don't want to be reactive, but proactive. This means you think about the end state and where you want to be, rather than getting there and reacting to the situation.
