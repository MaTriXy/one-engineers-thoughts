Working memory has a set of records. Records are type instances, and together they form a graph.

Working memory has the fully synthesized record. This is part of the recognition process.

- associative memory is a way to remember temporal logic experiences
- so, associative memory can encode temporal logic?
  - would mean, associative memory can encode experience
  - so, experience and memory of experience can be encoded in relations/triples

> If, however, integrative structure is interpreted as direct content, and elaborative structure as associative content, it is easy to see that the two are qualitatively different.
- Parallel Models of Associative Memory, pg 206

That's the key! Direct content is the "microfeatures" that are remembered in the associative memory, the key, and the response is the associative content.

This means, internal and external. Part and whole. This is how patterns can start to evolve together. Then "receptive fields" are when patterns respond positively to other patterns. This is growth and decay, life and death.

> CAM can be described as associative array logic

> There are a number of common abstract data structures including stacks, queues, trees and graphs which normally are implemented using address manipulation via pointers and indexes. Physical address relationships between data are not present in an associative processor. Instead structure codes, which are numeric representations of the abstract structural information, are asso- ciated with the data. The codes are generated automatically and appropriately named functions (e.g. parent(), sibling(), and child()) are used to manipulate them. The programmer need only be aware of the data structure type being used (e.g. tree, graph, etc.), and not the internal structure codes themselves.

> The
associative operations and unique characteristics of AI data structures and codes contributed to the overall
MISC Machine architecture being a hierarchical system composed of multiple SIMD arrays, each supervised
by a microprocessor forming part of a MIMD network. Each SIMD array serves as a separate associative
processor, operating either independently or in combination with other arrays. Each supervisor controls its
associative array, executes scalar operations and control structures too complex for the SIMD array, and
mediates communications. A full-scale MISC Machine might include millions of SIMD processing elements
and thousands of supervisor processors, requiring a highly scalable communications network.
