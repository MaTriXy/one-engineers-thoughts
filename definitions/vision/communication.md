> The evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience,[3] not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness.

> 1.1. Clean Designs Reduce the Effort Needed to Find Information

Elements placed near each other forms groups. This is because our vision is adapted to the natural environment, and most natural structures are formed in space from a central place. So our brain is adapted to look for groups of related functionality.

> small, unintentional visual differences are like sand in the engine of your visual brain.

> Our brains expect related content to be lined up neatly.

> Our brains expect related content to be lined up neatly. If something is slightly out of line, our brains assume there's a reason and try to find it. Since the last line of the ad ("Trapping Hands...") is out of line, our brains search for a reason. When they don't find one they send out minute amounts of grumpiness-inducing chemicals that cause us to consider the ad sloppy.

Your brain has to figure out the visual significance of elements. And so the goal is to reduce this effort.
