definition reality
  The world of an individual.
```

The world is the sum of the change of states of the internal and external worlds of the individual.

So reality is defined relative to a self.

The best story is the closest to reality, enabling the reader to directly experience the reality. So the more accurately you can model the _elements_ (patterns/structures/individuals/parts/pieces) of the story, the better the story will be for the individual. By _better_, the more usefully it will change the experience ("improve the life") of the other.
