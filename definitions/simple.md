A simple structure is one that can be easily encoded and decoded by a cognitive agent. So it's a transform to/from a storage structure.

stoic's were about simplicity, instead of riches, for happiness.

Magnanimity
Fate

Belief in fate breeds magnanimity.

Fate comes from one origin, the original source. So it is true, it is fate, but your experience contributes to the eventual fate, so in that sense, you have some control?

It is _simple_ if you can understand it just by reading it once. Your first impression is the correct impression.

Positive death experience.

Eventually you will be considered taking up space, and so you must die. This in temporal logic is what means _fairness_. So this means nobody will live forever. The question is, how does it look then to die? It must be then, _enjoyable to die_. You should feel when you die, that you have done everything you could to better the world, but now it's time to give way to the next. This happens because of the paths we take, we may lead up or down.

If you stay still for long enough, that is okay for all the life that has been created so far, and for even many future generations perhaps (haven't thought about relationships between generations yet). But _eventually_ (temporal logic), you will be _holding everything back_. You are essentially a space of _no new information_. So, you can be _remembered_, just a data point, but you don't need to _exist_ anymore, you can give way to the future generations. This is why nothing will live forever.
