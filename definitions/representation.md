> The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but the internal representation machine, investigating not just sign processes, or modes of inference, but the whole inquiry process in general. Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types. For example, signs can be icons, indices and symbols.

> Representation is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else.

A representation is a sign? Can't tell if these two words mean the same things yet.

A representation is an encoding of information. It is one of potentially many encodings.
