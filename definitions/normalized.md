Normalized is a bad word because it depends on your perspective.

A normalized database typically means every object in separate table. And denormalized db means flattened records. But you can call that normalized to, if it's from perspective of optimizing for api calls. It's normalized for the frontend calls. There is too much mental re-referencing that occurs when using this word.

A better word is to describe how it looks.

It's okay to talk about something being normalized if you have a clear definition of what it means to be normalized. The opposite of normalized (like for strings of input) is "not normalized", but you never really say that. You would say "it's unstructured or doesn't have a clear pattern", or it's "messy".
