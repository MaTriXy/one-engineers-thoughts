Something that is random is _unpredictable_, but not random like it "spontaneously" occurs without a cause.

> randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.

Should be `Math.unpredictableValue()` rather than `Math.random()`.

Random means you can't tell the origin of the information. So a coin flip, even though it is deterministic, because everything is cause and effect, it is still random, because we don't have the technology capable of determining the exact cause and effect. Because of this, we have _incomplete information_ (game theory), and so it becomes an effect that is _random_.

So random is really a relative concept, it is based on how much you are capable of knowing when you experience an event.
