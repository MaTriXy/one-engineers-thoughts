## What is Love

Baby, don't hurt me. No more.

Okay so. What is love? Love is the merging of individuals.

```
definition
  Love is the merging of many individuals.
  Love (process) is the patterns of change that lead to a gain in information
  Love is the propagation of information.
  The experience of love is an experience of a functional whole
```

Love is the experience an individual has when merging with another individual. The question then is, what does it mean to _merge_?

Merging is like, integrating all abilities and processes into one system. This means that you help them, they help you, you guys benefit each other, in the best way possible.

This is also how you can love anything, you can love sandwiches, or people, or rocks, or lizards, or your phone, or drama, or code, or skateboarding, or music, or the earth. You can love anything. And this means that the two of you are in some sense, _effectively one individual_.

Love means many individuals are effectively one individual.

- Your dog jumps on your lap whenever you want it to, and you take your dogs on long walks and feed it and provide it shelter and attention.
- Your phone, because it gives you any information you need, and it only cost a week's worth of work.
- Your partner for life. You can both talk to each other about anything, and know everything about each other, and can respond effectively.
- The threesome, where they have to communicate much more often, and think more logically, than two-pair couples, because there is a lot more information to be aware of. Have a lot more potential for jealousy, so requires more intelligent communication.
- The love the people have for the king. The people try to embody the king's laws. They try to _be_ what the king desires. They are _loyal_, and _honorable_.
- The love for your child. Some say it is undescribable. Others say it is non existent. This is a spectrum of levels of merging of two individuals into one. Evolution set us up for this, so it is built into our body, so it is very strong.

These are all different kinds of love.

## The process of merging individuals

The process of merging individuals. This is the process of love.

Merging is where two individuals come together to help each other. To solve each other's problems.

Is there love in math? Can patterns of change generate love?

Maybe, love would need to be the core thing. Love would be the patterns of information that would lead to a gain in information.

**Love would be the patterns of information that would lead to a gain in information.**

Hate, then is patterns of information that lead to a loss of information.

So, the paper then, would be about "The Love of Information" or something. Then, love is the pattern of memories, and actions, that lead to integration. Maybe love is a simple algorithm at the base, then. Or maybe it isn't. But then, love would be the base algorithm.

So the question then is:

- What are different ways that simple information blocks can be imagined to "love" each other?

A block can love it's creator. A creator can love it's child.

But then it starts to get complicated. There starts to be love and hate and a drama unfolds. This is because of the _sibling effect_ perhaps. Maybe it is such that, this is how there is a gain in information, because of **love being the implementation of the encoding process.**

The gain and loss of information is experienced as _good_ and _bad_ by the individual.

Love can also have a _limit_. Because it takes energy to love, you inevitably can't love everything equally. So then that's where the problems start coming in. How does that work? How would that look evolving as blocks?

This means that things have a birth and death. Death is the loss of information, birth is the gain of information. In some ways. But if we associate death with the body, we can separate it from death of our effect on the world, which is in a sense, permanent.

This is where the experience can come in. A distinction between death of:

- body
- experience
- effect

of individual. Or put another way:

- body
- soul
- spirit

So then this is why, even though our body dies, and in a sense, we lose information, our spirit lives on forever. It is part of the universe.

This would explain why we love things we have created. We are literally part of it. When we obtain things, we are sort of part of it by exchanging money. Other things provide endlessly, so they are always known.

The logic of love.

How would gravity work if it was due to love? What are the principles of love, then?

Love is due to _listening_, or merging of experiences. The _awareness of others_. So then, different kinds of loves are different kinds of awarenesses of others, and the effect this has as we take action.

So this means, each individual has a capacity to love. It is aware of the others. It can then _lose sight_ of information, or or completely lose it (information). Then the experiment is, what are the different types of love, and what universes do they lead to!

**In this sense, we are actively creating the universe, which evolves as a pattern of love and hate. Process of gaining and losing information.**

So the question is, what are the types of things that could be paid attention to, and what are the minimum requirements for love to generate new information?

This would mean love is the driver of the universe, with hate appearing every now and then. The creation of love and hate is birth and death.

What does it mean to actually love?

- they're helping you
- you're helping them
- your abilities are joined into 1

This means, you need to have problems. Every individual needs to have problems. One of the simplest problems is staying in existence. So if you both help each other, then you both stay in existence.

```
parent.child // keep child in existence, "care" about child
child.parent // keep parent in existence, "care" about parent
```

So basically, individuals need to care about things. Care about, or love, are pretty much the same thing. Care is a type of love where you keep them in existence and happy. But love can be more general then that, where you don't actually care for them.

It would then be good for children to care about each other. This would help keep them in existence, and out of trouble.

But maybe there are interesting facts that get paid attention to more for some reason. That is, how does love become unbalanced? Need to explore ways in which love could become unbalanced, maybe by finding limits of love.

If the gain of information comes at the loss of other information, then it isn't ideal. Gain in one area comes at a loss in another. This is where pain and suffering come in. We gain consciousness of our experience, which permanently effects the world, while our body dies and goes away.

The universe is just a bunch of layers of codes. The codes must all work together and form functional wholes. It evolves into everything we see today.
