Instead of saying:
"What needs to be done is relative"
say:
"But couldn't done be relative?"
```

Success means you've done what needs to be done. Couldn't _done_ be considered relative?

Yes. Success is relative.

What does it mean to be successful?

It means you do what needs to be done.

What needs to be done?

Anything that you imagine needs to be done.

What do you imagine? What does it mean to imagine?

To imagine is to simulate an experience. So you simulate an experience, which is itself an experience.

Anything that you have an experience of something needing to be done.

What do you mean, "Anything that you experience needs to be done"?

What does need mean?

It means we have a reason for a pattern/thing that is better than the current pattern/thing.

We have a physical reason for a thing that is better than the current thing.

So we have an experience that we physically feel is better than the curren thing.

Well, it would feel pretty physically bad if we were poor, and starving, and out in the cold, wouldn't it?

Wouldn't it physically feel better to be in a warm house next to a fire, with somebody who cares for you, and children tucked in bed. Wouldn't it be even better if you lived close to those you love, and they were also warm and had good food to eat and a loving family?

What better way is there to get rid of the fear of being kicked out of your home out into the cold, starving?

There is no better way than money. Money will immediately solve your problem. With the money you can immediately buy food, and buy shelter. But what about love? Can money buy love?

People cannot buy love from other people. Love is something that is directly experienced rather than bought.

So what do we do when we have enough to eat, and a place to sleep, but yet no one loves us? How do we get someone to love us?

We get lots of money. We show off our money. We buy them a nice dinner and smile at them and make them feel comfortable on nice furniture, in a warm house, with relaxing decorations, and mood-enhancing architecture. We buy expensive gifts and try to demonstrate our creativity and sense of taste.

But we know deep down that this does not lead to love. We cannot buy love.

Love can exist outside of all of these things. Money is not necessary for love.

With money you can buy these things. With money you can then, be happy. You can be successful.

This is why, today in America, to make money is to be successful.

But look at the definition of success one more time. 

You do what needs to be done.
Anything that you imagine needs to be done.
Anything that you experience needs to be done.
We have a physical reason for a thing that is better than the current thing.

Well, what if you have all the food you could ever eat? And all of the material you would ever need to build a house, and build creative projects? And there were people that loved doing exactly what you were doing, right when you were doing it?

In this world, you don't need to _do_ anything. You do only what needs to be done. Only what you feel like doing. With the caveat, you must balance everything you do with everybody else. Every other individual in existence.

This is true success. Doing only what needs to be done. Which means taking action in your life, while making it possible for everyone else to take actions in their life. This is different from being equal. It means everybody's capabilities are kept in an evolving balance.

Need vs. want.

Need is physical, want is mental.
