> Zeno's most influential follower was Chrysippus, who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

No central control.
Harmony with the universe.

Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:

Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to Antipater.
Middle Stoa, including Panaetius and Posidonius.
Late Stoa, including Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius.

Stoics didn't have digital technology, so they had to actually study and remember and practice this on their own. That is a lot of work, and takes a lot of discipline. And passion can easily overcome reason, and it feels natural to just give in every now and then. The stoics tried to master this, but it failed. It was too hard.

But now, imagine if you could always have access to all of knowledge, and you can do anything that you can imagine, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else. Now you can engage your passions if you desire. But you can also choose to engage in reason more if that's your thing. Either way is okay, as long is it allows the seed to continue to grow.

> Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control.

Ah, this is also why, _some of us_ are capable of engaging in pure logic, but it is an uncommon thing. People take logical shortcuts, which is something that alcohol is good for. They ignore certain aspects of their life, such as the pain they are causing to people (like the slaves), or torture of people for the "greater good".

The other problem with all of these philosophies is they are _different_. Everyone thinks there is going to be one philosophy that is above them all. But there isn't. All philosophies are perspectives of individuals with certain types of experiences. Philosophies are _unique to an individual_. So this means, there needs to be a framework in which any philosophy can coexist with any other philosophy.

The stoics are no better than the americans, and the americans are no better than the terrorists, in this sense. We all have different philosophies. The problem is, they haven't figured out how to coexist. This is because the groups at war are composed of individuals who all think their philosophy is better than the other.

This will never work.

There has to be a realization that all philosophies are different, and that it is okay as long as it maximizes happiness for every individual, from atoms to cells to animals to humans, so the seed can continue to grow and change.

This means, there is a maximum time anything can stay unchanged. It also means there can be tricks on how to keep moving yet appear unchanged at a higher level, like the atom which appears to have a shape, yet is composed of complex overlapping waveforms.

It also means, there is a spectrum of how things can change, from very short to very long. Some things can stay alive for a very long time, like the atoms, while others that depend on them, can't as much. And we depending on the cells, can't outlast them.

So in terms of "ideal behavior", you can do whatever you like as long as it doesn't keep the universe too static for too long, and create essentially a _non-information zone_.

> Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being mentally and spiritually at peace, with enough knowledge and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of discord or stress.

Should have a complete overview of all religions by the time the seed paper comes out. This way it is clearly different and the same to others.
