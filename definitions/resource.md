A resource is something that you can use again. It is information that you can re-source. You can make this information a source of information again, in the same or a different context.

> The first explicit definition of resource is found in RFC 2396, in August 1998: 'A resource can be anything that has identity. Familiar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., "today's weather report for Los Angeles"), and a collection of other resources. Not all resources are network "retrievable"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be considered resources.' Although examples in this document were still limited to physical entities, the definition opened the door to more abstract resources.
