Intelligence can exist without life. Intelligence just means effective problem solving ability, where problems involve a desire to change the world from it's current state to some desired/potential state. An agent doesn't need to reproduce or anything in order to be intelligent. Evolution just did this because life is simpler than intelligent. Reproduction is easier than storing information used to intentionally solve problems.

Intelligence can happen without life. Life isn't necessary for intelligence.

Life is a system that composes reproduction, reactivity, growth, development, and self-regulation, and is composed of cells. There is no clear definition of life though, it mainly seems to be how closely they feel like us.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis

> If something does not contain at least one cell, it is not alive. Fire does not contain cells. -- Living things contain DNA and/or RNA, proteins which contain the basic information cells use to reproduce themselves. Fire does not contain DNA or RNA.

Life uses a stored information structure to regulate it's existence to the natural environment. But that "regulation" can be intentional (intelligent problem solving) or reactionary (purely chemical responses to stimuli). So somehow information structures got stored that were automatically used to regulate a system, and that system can reproduce. I don't think reproduction is necessary though. A computer (you might think) can do everything life can do but reproduce, but it seems that actually it can't regulate it's own existence with the natural environment. It has to be controlled by an external intelligent agent like a programmer. Life can also adapt to changing environments, or evolve. But anything can also evolve. So then, the distinguishing things of life are that _it has a stored information structure that is used to encode actions it can perform to transform it's environment_.

Life is a structure that contains stored information structures used to maintain homeostasis and wholeness?

At first glance, life _feels_ like things that react in response to you doing something to them, in a way that is not a simple physical reaction. That's our "intuitive definition" of life. But trees are pretty physical, yet they grow. So if it grows, then it's alive. But other things grow like storms, but they don't react when you do things to them. So it must grow and respond. So that's why our definition of life is weird.

>  a possibility, first suggested by Francis Crick,[101] is that the first life was based on RNA,[100] which has the DNA-like properties of information storage and the catalytic properties of some proteins.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis

Life is composed of a stored information structure, and a network of chemical reactions based on that stored information structure, used to keep the life structure in existence.

> cells are known as "building blocks of life"

> RNA is thought to be the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions.

Self-replication can occur outside of life.

A tropon is an information structure.

Life is artifact-making. Just after copymakers and codemakers. Nature made artifacts. This is where problem solving started, and intelligence started. And so this may have been the origin of consciousness.
