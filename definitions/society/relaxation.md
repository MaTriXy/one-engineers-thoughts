Challenge (problem) vs. skill (knowledge).

If challenge is too high, and skill is too low, anxiety occurs. If skill is average, and challenge is low, then you're bored. If skill is low, and challenge is low, then you don't care at all about it (apathy). If skill is high, and challenge is low, then that is relaxation.

This is why, if you have money and can afford an all-inclusive vacation, then you have high skill (the ability to afford such a vacation perhaps?), but there are very few problems you have to solve (low challenge).
