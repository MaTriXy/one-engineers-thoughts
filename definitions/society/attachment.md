It's like a child experiences anxiety when not with their mother because they don't know how to solve many problems they face, or feel like they will be able to solve unforseen problems they will face. They are used to relying on the mother to solve the problems. And maybe this relying on someone else, or trusting, is the core reason for a bond. The need to be physically close then just triggers the same mechanisms in the brain to cause trust. he brain should already have this built in, but maybe it doesn't yet because it's more efficient to just have it be "learnable knowledge". In the same way that play is a natural way for a child to gain knowledge of the world through experience, without encoding the knowledge directly, physical and emotional attention is a way for a child to gain trust through experience. But while gaining explicit knowledge gained through play is okay, not that harmful day to day not having it, not having the ability to trust is harmful in the long run. So the brain should know how to trust in advance, it's just that it hasn't been able to yet because evolution hasn't found a way to encode that and pass it on from generation to generation without having to go through the bonding process.

> Bonding is a mutual, interactive process, and is different from simple liking. Bonding typically refers to the process of attachment that develops between romantic partners, close friends, or parents and children. This bond is characterized by emotions such as affection and trust.
