Cortisol isn't a neurotransmitter.

> stress is a feeling of strain and pressure

Balancing problems you create for yourself that you can solve, vs. problems you create that you can't solve.

Some problems you create can be instantly solved, and so are easily enjoyable and fun (like children playing, zooming cars around a track, or stacking blocks).

Some problems can be created easily, but you can't solve (such as knowing whether your boss will fire you or not, or if you're going to die soon, etc.). There can be physical stresses (problems created for the body), and mental stresses (stresses created for the mind).

> Humans experience stress, or perceive things as threatening, when they do not believe that their resources for coping with obstacles (stimuli, people, situations, etc.) are enough for what the circumstances demand.

```coffee
definition stress
  ? Stress is the experience that an agent cannot effectively solve a set of problems in a current situation. ?
```

To relieve stress:

- humor (play with information, engaging in learning)
- laughter
- social network support (understanding your problems)
- thinking positively
- exercise...

Since there is a backward relation between physical action and mental states, we can "hack" our mental states by performing physical actions. This is independent of intelligence, it is just how humans have evolved.
