International day of happiness 28 June 2012. Release the model language on the International day of happiness :)

"living a good life"
"flourishing"
"pursuit of happiness"
"quality of life"
"well-being"

All of this has to do with effectively solving problems, and helping others solve problems (increasing other's ability to solve problems).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being

High well-being is the general sense that an experience is positive. Low well-being is negative general experience.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life

High well-being means a high quality of life. If life is problem solving, then quality of life is quality of problem solving. How effective you are at problem solving, and how you contribute to the problem solving ability of other agents. So happiness is effective problem solving ability. But not just any problems, but problems relevant to you. This is why 9-5 jobs are bad! The problems aren't relevant to most people (find statistics on this). Instead, to increase happiness, we need to make it so agents can effectively solve problems that are relevant to them, and help others solve problems that are relevant to others.

> Standard indicators of the quality of life include not only wealth and employment but also the built environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging.

Example problems in each domain of life:

- Wealth: Solving the problem of having resources, for survival and reproduction.
- Environment: Solving the problem of having a space to effectively problem solve in.
- Mental: Solving the problem of having an effective brain for problem solving.
- Physical: Solving the problem of having an effective body for problem solving.
- Education: Solving the problem of understanding the world for effective problem solving.
- Recreation and leisure time: Solving the problem of gaining knowledge through direct experience. (Need to know more about leisure time, maybe relaxation is something, but not sure yet.)
- Social belonging: Solving the problem of trusting and gaining trust of others, to get help in problem solving.

What is "effective" is probably relative to what is imagined possible, and what others are generally doing. Which means that depression can be because you for some reason imagine that you should be able to fly, but can't, even though no one else can. This is why you focus on problems that are possible for you to solve, but not highly impossible (given the current state of the world, like technology etc.).

> One approach, called engaged theory, outlined in the journal of Applied Research in the Quality of Life, posits four domains in assessing quality of life: ecology, economics, politics and culture.

> Within the field of healthcare, quality of life is often regarded in terms of how it is negatively affected, on an individual level, a debilitating weakness that is not life-threatening...

> In positive psychology, flourishing is “to live within an optimal range of human functioning, one that connotes goodness, generativity, growth, and resilience.”

Evolution has taught us that we need to be part of a group to get help. It's not that we need to feel a social connection, that is just the symptom. The feeling of needing a social connection, or to feel part of a group, is an evolutionary adaptation to make sure that we can get help from others to solve problems in our lives when necessary. And to make this possible, we need to help them solve problems.

**So then the main question for AI good/badness is, can one AI agent effectively solve all problems, or does there need to be multiple agents? So the one major question to figure out is, could there be only 1 intelligent agent that knew everything, or does there have to many more than 1 intelligent agent? That is, if the 1 intelligent agent knew everything that 1 billion intelligent agents knew, which one would survive? If it turns out to be provably true that the "many agent situation" would be more effective at problem solving than the "one agent", then we know AI will turn out good, because intelligent social systems strive for effective problem solving for themselves and for others. If it turns out that it is _not_ true, that instead the "one agent situation" is more effective at problem solving, then this could be bad, since it only has to increase it's own problem solving effectiveness. So the main test is, how to prove which is more effective at problem solving, one or many intelligent agents?** Some sub-questions are: are there physical limitations in how information is stored and transfered/communicated such that it is more effective having a distributed system than a centralized system? Can a single intelligent agent actually be equivalent to a set of intelligent agents? It's like a tropon, a part and a whole. The whole can be considered a single intelligent agent, but the parts can be the single most intelligent agents, interacting in a network to increase the total problem solving effectiveness.

"human flourishing"

> Etymologically, it consists of the words "eu" ("good") and "daimōn" ("spirit")

Literally, good spirit. So, a good effect on others. This means you can do things for your benefit, as long as they also have a good effect on others.

> Stoics make virtue necessary and sufficient for eudaimonia and thus deny the necessity of external goods.
