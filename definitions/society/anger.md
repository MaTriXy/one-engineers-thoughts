> Anger or wrath is an intense emotional response. Often it indicates when one's basic boundaries are violated.

So as an agent, you have knowledge and perform actions based on input. If you don't know how to handle the input, you may experience anxiety. If you know how to handle the input but it is outside your accepted set of desirable actions (maybe?), you may experience anger or frustration.

Anger is used as a response to stop an unwanted action. From an evolutionary standpoint, if someone takes your child, or someone tries to kill you or take your food, or hurt you in some way, the evolutionary response is to get angry, to stop that behavior. Frustration is along the same spectrum perhaps, but it's for things that aren't as intense, like if you can't automate a problem, or things stand in your way of solving problems. Unwanted actions can prevent you from solving problems, or create problems for you. Maybe frustrations are when things make it hard to solve problems, and anger is when new problems are created for you that you don't want. Even then, a new problem can be frustrating if it is not as intense.

The solution to the main problem of survival is to stay alive. The solutions for staying alive are fight or flight when an unwanted action occurs that threatens your survival. When unwanted actions occur at a lower level in the problem-solution space, then it is more subtle anger, frustration.
