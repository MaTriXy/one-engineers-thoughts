Trust is the knowledge/understanding that other cognitive agents will have a positive relationship with you. That is, they will help you solve problems when you need their help.

Evolution never built trust into the brain, because maybe it didn't need to. Since a mother had to carry her child around for it to survive, as a byproduct of this "attention" it would develop trust. That is, the brain can release oxytocin to the experience of being listened to and touched, to learn to trust in others. Learn that others will help them solve problems when necessary.

The brain never needed to directly pass this on from generation to generation, which would've taken more refining. Instead, it "just worked" to have the new agent (infant) learn through experience to trust other agents.

In this sense, trust and play are very similar. For play, the brain hasn't evolved a way to pass on all knowledge a parent has learned to the child. So it found a hack, to make it enjoyable for a new agent to play, to "learn on it's own".

So play is based on dopamine, and trust is based on oxytocin. These two neurotransmitters help the brain gain different types of knowledge. Knowledge that it can learn on it's own, and knowledge that other agents will provide help rather than harm.

Everything that they imagine you are, you actually are. You do what you say. I can make a prediction of your behavior based on your past actions, and know that you will act that way.

Trust is both logical and emotional. When you cry, it seems to be about trust.
