God is what an individual without a complete and coherent scientific model may call the whole system of which it is a part, as if it was intentionally controlling everything. This would mean that most individuals without a conscious mathematical model of the world would more easily understand the world if god did everything.

To these same people, a spirit is the effect an individual has in the world.

And a _soul_ is the sum total of experience of the individual.
