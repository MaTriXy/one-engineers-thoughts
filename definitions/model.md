> A conceptual model is a model made of the composition of concepts, which are used to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents

Used to solve problems. A set of concepts.

Conceptualization from observation of information.

Conceptual modeling is the activity of formally describing some aspects of the physical and social world around us for the purposes of understanding and communication.

A conceptual model's primary objective is to convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system in which it represents.

The purpose of a model is to represent information.

A model is interpretation of information. (A model is interpretation of reality).

> The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system for which reality is the only interpretation. The world is an interpretation (or model) of these sciences, only insofar as these sciences are true.

A model is an interpretation of information in a universe.

A model is used to solve problems.

> A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language.

A model seems like it's more _intentional_ than a sign or symbol. It's goal is to explicitly create an easy to communicate sign, that fits in with all other knowledge in a logical way.

The model language is one such tool for an intelligent agent.

  A model is a set of patterns used to solve problems.
```

A model is a set of useful patterns. Where useful means they are used to solve problems. A model is a set of patterns used to solve problems.

> â€¢ Models are State Transition Graphs or Kripke Structures
