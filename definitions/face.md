To _face_ something is to be _conscious_ of it. To be _aware_ of it. If you are getting defensive about your friends, or loved one, it is bad to ignore it and try to hide it. it is also bad to act out on it. it is best to _face_ it. to _recognize_ it as something that is happening. once you face it, it becomes a _conscious thing_. You now can then _deal_ with it. First face, then deal.

```
face
understand
deal
```

This is how you _improve_. You first have to become aware. But we want to try to "man power" over it. But this is bad, because it means we are not fully conscious of it. We are _emotionally_ reacting to it.

_Emotion_ is the physical experience that is being processed to understand the environment. It is below _conscious control_. So to "just do it" means, we don't fully understand what we are doing, but have to have strength to do it anyways. In a sense, to force ourselves, without knowing why.

But that fails a LOT.
