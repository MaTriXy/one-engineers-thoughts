Because there is a universe of information, there are many structures, at least more than one. If there are two structures, they exist in the universe, and so that is their first relation. A relation exists because of the fact there is more than one recognizable structure. Relations exist.

```
assumption
  Relations exist?
```

A relation is also how a cognitive agent allows for quick access to knowledge to two structures. A pattern between them is sort of established.

So when there are structures, there are relations.

These, however, are just types. Types are models, used to solve the problem of understanding.

So we can formalize this into a symbolic language:

```
type type

type information

type structure
  from information
  from other structures and relations # recursion

type relation
  btwn structures
```

All we're doing here is modeling the relation between us and the world.

A relation exists because patterns don't form in isolation. An assumption about the universe is that structures spontaneously form.

```
assumption (based on observation)
  Some types of information structures spontaneously form.
```

```
definition spontaneous
  A structure occurring without a cause.
```

A type is like a name a cognitive agent uses to store and retrieve information structures.
