A thought is like a construction of a pattern recognizer given some problem. Thoughts are the patterns invoked when given a problem to solve. They may not solve the problem, but they are things that get evoked, that "come up", that "come into your head" when given a problem to solve, or "something to think about" (thinking is an action, which is solving a problem).
