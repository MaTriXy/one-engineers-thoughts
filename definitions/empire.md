> Imperialism is a type of advocacy of empire.

> "imperium", meaning to rule over large territories

> Imperialism is defined as "an unequal human and territorial relationship, usually in the form of an empire, based on ideas of superiority and practices of dominance, and involving the extension of authority and control of one state or people over another."

> To be clear, we are absolutely imperialistic, and one day we will want all these customers. But no army ever conquered anything by marching outward from their base in an ever-spreading concentric circle. -- peter at segment

> The question is really: which customers do we care about NOW? what part of the market do we have to completely corner in the next 12 months? to be on track for total domination as the world’s first and only customer data hub?

We want this "total domination" so we can have the money, and so, power. It's not because it will create the best solution necessarily.

So the question is, do you need an empire to solve the most problems the most efficiently, or can it be done by other means?

To figure that out, you need to have a value system, defining what is good and bad. You need to know what types of problems we can solve, and how much coordination and central control is required to implement the solution. Have to deal with human motivation as well.

> If we can corner that part of the market, we’re confident we’ll have shut the door on competitive threats, set ourselves up to be a darling in the tech industry, and can easily expand to larger and smaller companies. -- peter at segment.

"We must crush it, and totally focus". You have to do this so you can innovate at faster speeds than other intelligent agents that would prevent you from getting control. It seems to be a game that we needed in order to survive when there isn't a purely rational society, but that doesn't necessarily lead to the most effective problem solving techniques. Are there any more efficient/effective problem solving techniques, that allow individuals to enjoy themselves, that would solve more problems, and at the same time prevent people from being taken over by someone else who moves faster?

stages:

- 1-25 people on team
  - here, you only need one or two tools, and that is enough
- 25-500 people on team
  - above 25, companies start to have the need to use a lot of tools, and experience a lot of pain using them, so they could use a better abstraction
- 500+ people on team
  - here, you need to start implementing complicated permissioning and handling privacy of everyone, in addition to using tons of custom tools
  - have more organization hierarchy
  - need more collateral supported by sails
  - slow sales cycle, so prevents you from learning from your sales quickly
  - need big enterprise support team to help them

> We need to move faster, and faster means focus.

problem some industries have so much red tape, that it takes forever to get to market, so you slow down and lose to competition

> if Colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, Imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally
