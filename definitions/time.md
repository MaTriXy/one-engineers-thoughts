> Time is a measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.

> Time has long been a major subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, **but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars.**

Definition should not be circular or self-referential.

> The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of "container" that events and objects "move through", nor to any entity that "flows", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events.

> The Planck constant (denoted h, also called Planck's constant) is a physical constant that is the quantum of action in quantum mechanics.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant

> Planck discovered that physical action could not take on an arbitrary value. Instead, the action must be some multiple of a very small quantity (later to be named the "quantum of action" and now called Planck constant).

> the granularity of nature appears smooth to us
> it is impossible, as Planck discovered, to explain some phenomena without accepting the fact that action is quantized

> The Planck constant is related to the quantization of light and matter.

> time evolution can also refer to the change in observable values 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_of_time

> Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:
> 
It is vividly recognized by consciousness.
It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical.
It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals.

Time is a computer clock for synchronizing the calls to subroutines in a distributed parallel calculus. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-DE-15uvPk?t=22m14s
