A business is an agent with a goal of accumulating money.

It does this by solving problems of other agents. But it only solves them so that it can accumumulate the most money. This means the best business would accumulate all of the money.

The amount of money an agent has is directly related to the power it has to create effects in an intelligent world.

This means businesses can have a large effect on the world. But since they are only a small representation of the problem, and their solutions aren't to the most important problems in the world necessarily, that there is sort of an unfair accumulation of information structures. Meaning they can change the world according to how they see fit, rather than how individuals see fit.

The actual purpose of intelligence is, however, to solve problems. So we should be finding a way to maximize the solutions to problems.

An alternative to business would need to find a way to allow more efficient problem solving, and _prevent the prevention of problem solving of others_. (By accumulating wealth, you prevent others from solving problems).
