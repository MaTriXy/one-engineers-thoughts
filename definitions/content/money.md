Money is a medium of exchange. It is sort of a representation that can be used in place of an actual information structure. Or it is an information structure that can be exchanged for arbitrary information structures, making it so value can be exchanged indirectly.

This means the agents with the most _wealth_ (accumulated money) can obtain the most information structures.
