> Think of graphic designers as communicating information, and visual designers as being focused on the look and feel of the product and brand. https://blog.generalassemb.ly/what-type-of-design-is-right-for-you/

First design for information. Once the information flow is there, that solves the base problem.

Then enhance it for the medium. If it's text, write an engaging story, if it's 3d graphics, create an immersive experience. If it's a user interface, make it visually pleasing. In all cases, make it easy to use.

> Jef Raskin also mentions that "users should set the pace of an interaction," meaning that a user should not be kept waiting unnecessarily.
