> Change refers to a difference in a state of affairs at different points in time.

> Calculus is the mathematical study of change.

But calculus is with respect to time when you talk about differences in the state of the universe. It doesn't have a clear model of time.

Information can change at a constant rate of plank's constant? How to state this without "rate", which implies a change relative to time.

The smallest difference is plank's constant.

An information structure can be different no more than once in planck's constant.

An information structure can be different no more than once between two structures of the universe.

Given two structures of the universe in sequence, a substructure can't change more than...

**Definition**: There can be no more differences in structures than there are frames in the universe.

**Definition**: Creation of frames is planck's constant.

A substructure can't change more than the universe changes.

Change is the creation of a new frame.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms

But frames aren't really "created", the information is just "changed".

A frame is an update of the universe. Updates occur at planck's constant.

A structure can have no more than one difference from itself if the universe has only one difference from itself.

If our brains don't like change, then why do we get excited to solve problems? Maybe the reason is, when the world is changing, we have to adapt. We don't like this experience. But we like the experience of us solving the problem so we don't have to adapt anymore :)

Change is an encoding of the current pattern into a next pattern.

> In Hinduism, Brahman (/ˈbrɑːmən/; Sanskrit: ब्रह्मन्) connotes the highest Universal Principle, the Ultimate Reality in the universe.[1][2] In major schools of Hindu philosophy it is the material, efficient, formal and final cause of all that exists.[2][3][4] It is the pervasive, genderless, infinite, eternal truth and bliss which does not change, yet is the cause of all changes.[1][5] Brahman as a metaphysical concept is the single binding unity behind the diversity in all that exists in the universe.[1]
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)
> Ātman is the first principle,[1] the true self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain liberation, a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman.

Everything starts from a single pattern that recognizes itself, constructing patterns that get stored in the memory. This eventually evolves patterns such as atoms. The patterns on top of atoms, cells. Then life, then us. Intelligent beings. Intelligent humans. Intelligent patterns. We got here by having social groups be the core of driving force of intelligence. But this requires identities. We became individuals, members of a group. Of a society. But because we are problem solving machines, problem solving agents, the main driver is intelligence. Intelligence (problem solving) is a force. It is an automatic force that arises from self-encoding structures such as the tropon. So we are problem solving agents. And driven by intelligence. Social forces play against this. They make it hard for intelligence to thrive. Social forces are why money is held by few. Our "society" is just that, a social group, governed by social forces. But really, the lower level driving factor is intelligence. Socialness was just a means to an end, to bring about conscious intelligence perhaps. Really, we are not individuals in a society, we are problem solving machines, part of a complex "problem solving network". That is, our true purpose is to fully participate in the problem solving network. This is pretty much the same as what the brahman, atman, karma, and nirvana are about in buddhism (just saw that today). Instead of identifying with an individual, separated from the "one true thing", we are part of this vast intelligent force. A problem solving network, the force of intelligence. We are that intelligent force.

This force is a property of the universe. It will always eventually occur (temporal logic). Therefore, the universe is a finite automaton haha.
