Do 360 degree video with parents during holidays. Get my dad to buy that, get Kristina's parents to get it too, and walk them through it. Walk them through step by step how to use it. Do live streaming with them. It will be like we are there with each other.

We can buy a nicer camera for ourselves, so we can use it for work as well. They can just get a cheaper one because at least they will be participating.

Then we can get everyone the goggles. We'll buy some cardboard ones in bulk. And then walk everyone through the event. Create essentially a step-by-step family tutorial to get everyone onboard with new technology. It will be fun and playful. It will take a long time. But it will be like family just spending time together like the old days.

Then any time we need to learn new things, we can call our parents, and they can explain stuff to us, or whatever.

Startup to create family accounts. That way you can get your parents into the technology, to keep them in the loop. This is because as you get older, you start wanting to learn less typically. This way we can at least keep everyone in the loop, so we can live better and better lives together, and stay in touch with our family.

Apps to stay in touch with your family.
