Collaboration is "co-labor", while cooperation is "co-operate". Cooperation is more general. But even more general is co-existence. So really it boils down to co-existence. Then if you are taking action, then you can cooperate. And if you want to help each other, then you can collaborate. But collaboration can lead to imbalance.

> Cooperation evolves in the context of cognitive activities such as perception,
attention, memory, and decision making, in addition to physical activities such as hunting, gathering, warfare, and childcare .

Animals develop rituals around deceased, but you dont necessarily need to be conscious there. You could be just pattern recognizing.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_origin_of_religions

> Marc Bekoff, Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, argues that many species grieve death and loss

So basically, you are watching the others of your kind very closely, that you become like part of them, that when they go, part of you goes too. So a ritual of mourning occurs to adapt to these losses. This is not neceesarily conscious.
 So crows, and elephants can do this, but not be conscious.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toba_catastrophe_theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_modernity

Consciousness started when there was a realization of the self, from focusing deeply on animals.

> Archaeologist Richard G. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the stone tool kit of archaic hominids as impossible to categorize. It was as if the Neanderthals made stone tools, and were not much concerned about their final forms. He argues that almost everywhere, whether Asia, Africa or Europe, before 50,000 years ago all the stone tools are much alike and unsophisticated.

# Paper: Problem Solving Networks

500,000 years ago, stone tools. Hunting and gathering. Focusing on the animals, on nature. Until we realize we are one with nature, and in that moment realize a separation between us. We are now a self, separate from the one. [This is the moment the ancient narratives alude to]. In a sense, they are a version of the original narrative.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines

Carving stone statues 30,000 years ago. So they were conscious, and realizing their separation.

50,000 years ago, the origin of consciousness.

This is a rare event. The few who realize this, tell others. And they start waking people up. The news spreads. And now they are a group of self conscious individuals, collecting knowledge intentionally. They gather information about food and building homes. They learn how to harvest plants. And they hunt better. Some start to understand the mind of the animals themselves.

Eventually they start telling the origin story. They slowly start describing the trees, and the sun, and the moon, and the wind. The cycle of the seasons. They start aligning their activities with these patterns, and create harmony in art and music. Exploration of conscious pattern recognition.

When everybody is conscious now, and unified under a cohesive story about the universe, and can survive in a permanent place, a civilization forms. A civilization is a cooperative group of conscious agents. The gods that gave rise to this and that, they say.

Power then forms as our groups interact with each other. We move from egalitarian to hierarchical societies, because it is selectively advantageous. And we kill or punish anything that stands in our way, by allowing war and peace to coexist. We turn a blind eye so to speak.

This leads to corruption, and inequality. So self consciousness, essentially, leads to corruption and inequality, at least in the early stages. Then it tries to get rid of the corruption, and remove the inequality. This is where we are today. Resources have been collected in the hands of a few, and this is still happening today with investments, grants, and even the idea of work.

Until corruption can be eliminated, and the ideal problem solving network can be developed, there will be suffering. There will also be acting.

Acting arose after power. To gain power, you (a self-conscious agent) could act the correct way as deemed/interpreted by the one in power. This is where the kings court arose. And where politics is today. Political games are part of the process of obtaining power in this emergent system.

This is frustrating when you realize it, and how our suffering is tied to it, because we don't have the money or resources to do what's best, and so have to work for money, doing things the ones in power favor or allow. To make it go away, we need shared knowledge and abundant resources. 3d printing and the internet of things will make this possible.

Revolutions are attempts at reunifying the whole, in a sense, of removing self consciousness. Or becoming super conscious, or better, non conscious, something other than conscious. They occur in stages or large jumps, for some reason.

Religion is the first attempt at describing reality. Starting with magic.

Then they came up with these collective models of the world, their gods. That beset described the world, and led to a unified civilization, along with agriculture and common language and story.

Eventually, we developed technology and shared knowledge based on observation and experiment. So conscious agents gather knowledge through observation and experiment. All conscious agents are able to understand it quickly; first through information transcribed on clay, paper, or other natural materials, and now for the last half century transcribed into packets of light transmitted from specialized metals we've learned to distribute through space. Before that, through the church (cohesive). Before that, through each other (incohesive). Next, we will be be actually converting these packets of light into actual physical things that are interacting in an intelligent way with the rest of the universe. Literally converting information into matter.

Once all conscious agents can receive, understand, and act on a shared model of the universe in a manner that is fulfilling, then we are solving all problems in an ideal way, and therefore we no longer need to think or to act. We can just do what needs to be done, without seeking fame or luxury. In any moment or situation, you can perform the ideal action.

At this point, we are essentially a single problem solving network, and no longer even need to think about what we do. We are all masters. In a sense, we can do without thinking. In a sense, we no longer require consciousness for action. This means there is no need for consciousness. No need to enter into the world of happiness and suffering. Instead we are constantly fullfilled. We are one. We are perfect the way we are in every moment.

Instead of calling it a problem solving network, there is no longer a problem. Everything just is. It interacts, but without thinking. It works but doesn't take any credit. It listens, and is generous. In a sense, it is virtuous, without wanting to be virtuous. This is the natural state perhaps. 

[Conquer it, and you will ruin it.]

So, then, consciousness is like the rumpling in a typically smooth fabric, now starting to get smooth again.

A problem is only something consciousness experiences. A problem is the way a conscious agent understands the difference between two states, and desires one over the other.

So today we are forming an intelligent community. A peer to peer network for the common good. For that we need a definition of good. And a definition of purpose. Eventually, we will create the optimal problem solving network, so full of happiness, it is happiness. It is one. There is no longer a separation between good and evil. There is an entirely fulfilled problem solving network.

In a sense, this is the experience the early myths were hinting at. What it's like to have no separation between us and the one.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas

Instead of uncoscious, really it's more like superconscious, or just non-consciousness.

Companies want to play the game to win. They are individuals betting on teams, that will outcompete some other possible teams. "Being a team player" is desired. Working hard to make yourself and the company successul. But this is a game of opposites. It's a game deep in problem solving, with no way out. This is the main problem with working.

So in a sense, we return to the original state.

Conscious vs. non-conscious intelligence.

Dogs were domesticated in the last ice age.

85-65mya A group of small, nocturnal and arboreal, insect-eating mammals called the Euarchonta begins a speciation that will lead to the primate, treeshrew and flying lemur orders.

Ancestor of apes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiadapiformes

> It is possible that they are the first mammals to have developed finger nails in place of claws.

Most land masses had warm tropical or subtropical climates 65mya.
> The flora and fauna  click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced at the end of the Mesozoic Era  would have seemed alien since most of the plants and animals that are familiar to us had not yet evolved. 

At this point, mammals started to become more successful or intelligent than reptiles.

> The few placental mammals that existed at that time mainly consisted of the Insectivore  click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced ancestors of primates

There were no cattle at this time.

The proliferation of flowers had not yet occurred. 65 mya.

> The oldest known primate-like mammal species,[1] the Plesiadapis, came from North America

> Ancestors of the apes migrated south from Europe or Western Asia into Africa. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryopithecus. Walked similar to chimpanzee. It likely spent most of its life in trees, and was probably a brachiator, similar to modern orangutans and gibbons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy

Original mammals leading to humans were like squirrels, well adapted to life in the trees.

Eventually, grazing animals became abundant, leading to carnivores that could hunt them. This led to dogs and cats.

> the amount of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere more or less doubled around 50 million years ago, leading to larger brains. Brains have especially high oxygen requirements.

> Overall, climates were significantly warmer during the Eocene than now.  There were crocodiles in the Arctic, pine forests in the Antarctic, and palm trees in Wyoming.  There was no polar ice.  As a consequence, sea levels were close to 330 feet (100 m.) higher than today.

> Primal emotions, such as fear, are associated with ancient parts of the brain and presumably evolved among our premammal ancestors. Filial emotions, such as a human mother's love for her offspring, seem to have evolved among early mammals. Social emotions, such as guilt and pride, evolved among social primates.

Based on data from Kent Berridge, the liking and disliking reaction involving taste shows similarities among human newborns, orangutans, and rats. Most neuroscience studies have shown that dopamine alterations change the level of likeliness toward a reward, which is called the hedonic impact. This is changed by how hard the reward is worked for. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system

> The limbic system developed to manage fight or flight circuitry, which is an evolutionary necessity for reptiles as well as mammals (including humans)

> In most vertebrates, the medial part of the telencephalon – the medial pallium – comprises the limbic system.

> The hippocampal area appears to be present in lampreys and all jawed vertebrates.

> In the goldfish, the Dlv is situated in the predicted location for the hippocampus, and it has been established that it has memory and spatial mapping functions

> It seems, thus, that the functions of memory and spatial mapping of the hippocampus emerged at least twice independently – in teleosts and amniotes.

http://neurobiotaxis.livejournal.com/6648.html

> A defense system that co-ordinates fear and aggression, as well as an “approach” or “seeking” system that organizes and energizes the search for homeostatically important resources in the environment, seems to be present in all vertebrates.

Defense and seeking systems evolve in vertebrates. As opposed to simple drive and reflex systems.

So first the evolution of drive and reflex. Then defense and seeking.

> most invertebrates present clear approach-avoidance reflexes, if not drives

> Arthropods have a central brain with three divisions and large optical lobes behind each eye for visual processing.[19] Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.

> The sea slug Aplysia californica, was chosen by Nobel Prize-winning neurophysiologist Eric Kandel as a model for studying the cellular basis of learning and memory.

> In the literature, intensive studies of fundamental forms of learning, like habituation and sensitization, have been made, on a cellular level, using the sea slug Aplysia as a neural model.

> learning is an adaptive change in behavior as a result of experience.
> Memory is the process of storing and retrieving that experience.

> This reflex is quite similar to the quick withdrawal of a hand from a hot object.

> Aplysia has also been used to study the implicit or nondeclarative memory which is a fundamental form of memory. It describes the nonconscious recall and essential reflexive response to stimuli.

> the first brain structure appeared in worms over 500 million years ago. The functions of the hindbrain found by fossil records included breathing, heart beat regulation, balance, basic motor movements and foraging skills

Brain evolved 500 million years ago. So intelligence evolved essentially around them, when the first memory that could record experience was formed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_brain#Early_history_of_brain_development

> A new region of the brain developed about 250 million years after the appearance of the hindbrain. This region is known as the paleomammalian brain, the major parts of which are the hippocampi and amygdalas, often referred to as the limbic system. The limbic system deals with more complex functions including emotional, sexual and fighting behaviors.

So 250mya, emotion evolved.

Life is self-reproducing intelligence. Or life is reproducible intelligence. Life is evolvable intelligence. So this means intelligence could technically evolve before life. Only once it can reproduce, is it life. This also means reproducable structures like crystals aren't intelligent, because they just react to the environment.

Conscious vs. non-conscious problem solving. Difference between two states, and a memory to get you to that memorized state. It only become a problem that is actively solved once the structure is conscious of itself, and knows it can consciously manipulate it's own behavior. Then it realizes there is a problem. Before that, it is doing without thinking. So thinking is a conscious activity maybe? Or perhaps, consciously thinking. Thinking about thinking.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)

> A counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning. If this is accepted as definitive of intelligence, then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of "machine learning", but excludes those purely autonomic sense-reaction responses that can be observed in many plants. Plants are not limited to automated sensorymotor responses, however, they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of 'learning' (registering memories) from their past experiences.

> Virus self-assembly within host cells has implications for the study of the origin of life,[93] as it lends further credence to the hypothesis that life could have started as self-assembling organic molecules.

Some self-assembling cells aren't alive. But they are in a sense, intelligent. Viruses are in a sense, perhaps, intelligent.

https://www.quora.com/Could-a-virus-be-intelligent

Atoms don't have a memory, when they interact with other structures, they essentially change to different structures. We then classify these structures and say that atoms have different electron orbitals and such. But this is too simplistic. Really, there are these networks of changing structures, which themselves are stable, but they don't retain significant memory. Their memory can't be used to adapt behavior. Information cannot be learned or gathered. Only once information can be collected, or memorized, can it be said to be intelligent, perhaps. So cells that respond to the environment through fine tuning of their genes through interaction with the environment, can in a sense be called intelligent. They are memorizing their experience and using that memory to adapt their behavior. At what point, the, do we go from non-intelligent structures, to intelligent structures? Structures that change, and also retain information about the change. Atoms change, but they have no record of the change. Molecules change, but they also have no records of the change. Unless they start forming long chains of molecules. Chains of connected molecules start storing information. In a sense, rocks and planets are groups of molecules that store information. But rocks don't necessarily remember their experience, and use that memory to adapt to the environment. Or perhaps they do. Once this stored information can then be used to adapt to the environment, it is intelligent. So when molecules get complex enough that they can sense and move toward a nutrient source, or away from a threat, then they are intelligent. This doesn't necessarily require a brain either, just the ability to store information and use it to change behavior.

So intelligence may have emerged before life.

Prions are like viruses, they reproduce but aren't necessarily alive or intelligent. But maybe they are.

Rocks are perhaps in a sense, intelligent, but not alive.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation

> Other proteins act as nucleation sites for the formation of signalling complexes

Formation of signaling complexes.

So rocks don't have any signaling complexes. But materials that do, then, can use their knowledge to signal new action. Rocks have a memory, but they can't use that memory for action necessarily. Need to get a clearer understanding of this part.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization

Intelligence requires signaling and coordination of parts. So it can receive a signal, recall a memory, and act using that memory. Must be able to have receptors for signals, and transform those signals into signals that can recall memory, and then have those recalled memories turn into physical action. You don't necessarily need to be whole to do this, like a cell. So intelligence could have emerged without the cell, but maybe it was only after the cell. In the first case, intelligence emerged before life, in the second case, intelligence emerged with encapsulation and reproduction, which we call life.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_mat

> Microbial mats are the earliest form of life on Earth for which there is good fossil evidence, from 3,500 million years ago, and have been the most important members and maintainers of the planet's ecosystems.

> In a wet environment where sunlight is the main source of energy, the uppermost layers are generally dominated by aerobic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (blue-green bacteria whose color is caused by their having chlorophyll), while the lowest layers are generally dominated by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria.

So earliest life harvested energy essentially.

> Underwater microbial mats have been described as layers that live by exploiting and to some extent modifying local chemical gradients, i.e. variations in the chemical composition.

> The earliest mats were probably small, single-species biofilms of chemotrophs that relied on hydrothermal vents to supply both energy and chemical "food".

> Most inorganic solids are not crystals but polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together into a single solid. Examples of polycrystals include most metals, rocks, ceramics, and ice.

> A third category of solids is amorphous solids, where the atoms have no periodic structure whatsoever. Examples of amorphous solids include glass, wax, and many plastics.

Rocks have a memory, and are ordered. But they don't have signaling networks. Only once crystals and other aggregated/ordered structures can interact, and their interaction can change the memory in a way that is adaptationally successful, can intelligence occur. This is because signals in the environment can be transformed into essentially a thought? No, no thoughts at this point.

Intelligence evolved before the brain. It could even possibly have evolved before life, as intelligence is not required for life. Or, perhaps, life is intelligence.

Animal and plant are human concepts. When really there is just intelligent life.

Animals are intelligent agents that can move on their own? No but bacteria and trees are like this. They are ones we can see as moving, so they appear similar to us. So animals are how closely they are related to our own features.

After we got brains, we developed jaws. Hagfish had brains but no jaws.

> The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called "eyespots". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms.

So eyes evolved before brains. First photoreceptors could see differences in light, but not have vision as they could not distinguish shapes. Eyespots are common on unicellular organisms.

> Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the euglena to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis, and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglena

> Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles. By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation.

> eyes have a wide range of structures and forms, all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules.

> only six of the thirty-some phyla[note 2] possess such a system. However, these phyla account for 96% of living species

> Pit eyes, which had arisen by the Cambrian period, were seen in ancient snails,[clarification needed] and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today, such as planaria.

So eyes arrived by Cambrian explosion. Once they could have a visual model of the world, they could see and represent objects. They could hide, and move, and explore. They could see the environment for the first time!

> However, some jellyfish, such as Cladonema, have elaborate eyes but no brain. Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain.

So the eye could have evolved before the brain.

> During the Cambrian explosion, the development of the eye accelerated rapidly, with radical improvements in image-processing and detection of light direction.

The light receptor started to fold. This allowed the vision to be more focused. Early eyes like this are found in the nautilus https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus

> Overgrowths of transparent cells prevented contamination and parasitic infestation. The chamber contents, now segregated, could slowly specialize into a transparent humour, for optimizations such as colour filtering, higher refractive index, blocking of ultraviolet radiation, or the ability to operate in and out of water.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_the_eye

> It is likely that a key reason eyes specialize in detecting a specific, narrow range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum—the visible spectrum—is because the earliest species to develop photosensitivity were aquatic, and only two specific wavelength ranges of electromagnetic radiation, blue and green visible light, can travel through water. This same light-filtering property of water also influenced the photosensitivity of plants.

> Again, the division of layers may have originated with the shedding of skin

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_intelligence

> Characteristics of eumetazoans include true tissues organized into germ layers, the presence of neurons, and an embryo that goes through a gastrula stage.

That is the common ancestor of jellyfish and vertebrates.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumetazoa

Sponges have no nervous system, yet they are intelligent.

Early ancestor to all vertebrates, breaking from jellyfish: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain#/media/File:Bilaterian-plan.svg

Already have mouth and anus, and central tube for governing behavior, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a ganglion) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain.

Nematode is one of first vertebrate brains: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode, with a digestive system. So the brain starts to control their digestive system, to efficiently extract components from the environment and ensure survival.

> The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_nervous_systems

> Neurons developed as specialized electrical signaling cells in multicellular animals, adapting the mechanism of action potentials present in motile single-celled and colonial eukaryotes.

> Simple nerve nets seen in animals like cnidaria evolved first, followed by nerve cords in bilateral animals - ventral nerve cords in invertebrates and dorsal nerve cords surrounded by a notochord in chordates. Bilateralization led to the evolution of brains, a process called cephalization.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_net

> This nervous system allows cnidarians to respond to physical contact. They can detect food and other chemicals in a rudimentary way.

Early example of nerve net: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(genus)

>  Hydra, which are cnidarians, have a nerve net throughout their body. On the other hand, sea stars, which are echinoderms, have a nerve net in each arm, connected by a central radial nerve ring at the center. This is better suited to controlling more complex movements than a diffuse nerve net.

Porifera do not have nervous systems.

Boundary between nerves and non-nerves:
> Porifera is an extant phylum within the animal kingdom, and species belonging to this phylum do not have nervous systems. Although Porifera do not form synapses and myofibrils which allow for neuromuscular transmission, they do differentiate a proto-neuronal system and contain homologs of several genes found in Cnidaria which are important in nerve formation.[1] Sponge cells have the ability to communicate with each other via calcium signaling or by other means.[2] Sponge larvae differentiate sensory cells which respond to stimuli including light, gravity, and water movement, all of which increase the fitness of the organism. In addition to sensory cells differentiated during development, adult Porifera display contractile activity.[3]

> The emergence of nervous systems has been linked to the evolution of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels. The Nav channels allow for communication between cells over long distances through the propagation of action potentials, whereas voltage-gated (Cav) calcium channels allow for unmodulated intercellular signaling.

The development of the brain was a massive step forward in intelligence, but it wasn't the origin of intelligence. The development of the brain let to the explosion of forms of life, that was significantly better at adapting to new environments.

> Developmental neurogenesis of nerve nets is conserved between phyla and has been mainly studied in cnidaria, especially in the model organism Hydra.

> For instance, drosophila have a homologous limbic system - the part of the brain that deals with behavior and emotion:  the mushroom bodies.   When the mushroom bodies are ablated, flies show altered behavioral responses such as reduced centrophobism  (avoiding the center of an arena) and thiogmotaxis (the tendency to stay close to walls) Centrophobism and thigomotaxis are well established as indicators of anxiety – an emotive behavior - in mammals. Flies also respond to valium – the  first line treatment for panic and anxiety – in the way you would expect. (1)  They get angry too: intermale aggression can be exaggerated with pheromones homologous to those known in vertebrates (2) . Of course there is the caveat that flies exhibiting emotive behaviors are only assumed to be feeling emotions – but the behavioural evidence is there.

> Insects live short, fast lives of instinct.

Life is self reproducing intelligence.

> The synapsids are traditionally divided into a primitive group and an advanced group, known respectively as pelycosaurs and therapsids.

The synapsids are the ancestors to the mammals.

> Over time, as synapsids became more mammalian and less 'reptilian', they began to develop a secondary palate, separating the mouth and nasal cavity

Mouth and nose separated to form mammals.

> Synapsids are characterized by having differentiated teeth.

> While the skin of reptiles is rather thin, that of mammals has a thick dermal layer.

So reptiles developing a thicker skin led to mammals.

> Unlike the scales of lizards and snakes, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface.

> In all bilaterian animals, the mesoderm is one of the three primary germ layers in the very early embryo.

So skin, the mesoderm, developed at the origin of bilaterata, which was the split of the jellyfish and the vertebrates. So just before jellyfish, skin.

It formed from the germ layer during embryogenesis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_layer.

> all eumetazoans, (animals more complex than the sponge) produce two or three primary germ layers.

> Among animals, sponges show the simplest organization, having a single germ layer.

So the skin forms during the sponges, which has the simplest skin.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge#Evolutionary_history

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doushantuo_Formation
> considerable insight has been gained into the embryonic and larval stages of many early creatures

> Well-preserved fossil sponges from about 580 million years ago in the Ediacaran period have been found in the Doushantuo Formation

> Metazoa evolved from very sponge-like ancestors and therefore that sponges may not be monophyletic, as the same sponge-like ancestors may have given rise both to modern sponges and to non-sponge members of Metazoa

> The first evidence of multicellularity is from cyanobacteria-like organisms that lived 3-3.5 billion years ago
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism#Evolutionary_history

> In order to reproduce, true multicellular organisms must solve the problem of regenerating a whole organism from germ cells (i.e. sperm and egg cells), an issue that is studied in developmental biology.

> Animals have evolved a greater diversity of cell types in a multicellular body (100–150 different cell types), compared with 10–20 in plants, fungi, and protoctists.[10]

> This theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from symbiosis (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicellular_organism#The_symbiotic_theory

They are still not sure how multicellularity could have evolved.

Remaining synapsids were small like a shrew.

> Tight junctions have low electrical resistance and high permeability to molecules. They are also in great number in embryos, suggesting that the electrical potentials of cells joined in this manner serve as a driving force for the movement of ions and even nutritive substances from one cell to the next. This phenomena suggest that electrically mediated junction transmission is older than chemically mediated synaptic transmission, which would require that some epithelial cells secrete chemical substances.
http://ucadia.com/uca/u13/130900.htm

> It is now believed that neurons originated from epithelial secretory cells that could secrete chemical substances, respond to stimulation and conduct impulse.

Neurons arise from mutation in skin cells, which are being held together by electrical signals over short distances, essentially.

Evolution of senses essentially:

- taste (food, eating)
- sight
- sound?
- smell

Then mammals lost 2 of their color receptors, as a feature of being nocturnal and burrowing. Then primates start to move away from this nocturnal, burrowing lifestyle, and got a mutation for a 3rd color receptor, for better vision for detecting red and orange fruits in trees, as opposed to green. This meant better nutrition for them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_color_vision

> Another theory is that detecting skin flushing and thereby mood may have influenced the development of primate trichromate vision. The color red also have other effects on primate and human behavior as discussed in the color psychology article.[8]

Most apes are trichromatic.

> Except for gorillas and humans, hominoids are agile climbers of trees. Their diet is best described as frugivorous and folivorous, consisting mainly of fruit, nuts, seeds, including grass seeds, leaves, and in some cases other animals, either hunted or scavenged, or (solely in the case of the humans) farmed—along with anything else available and easily digested.

Evolution of 3-part ear in mammals: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_mammalian_auditory_ossicles

> Bony fishes detect vibrations through their "earstones" called otoliths.

> vestibular labyrinth of vertebrates

So after they had the spine, they got the ear.

> They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration.

Ability to sense motion.

> Because otoliths evolved as part of the inner ear to serve the senses of balance and hearing.

> The mirror test allows scientists to determine whether birds are conscious of themselves and able to distinguish themselves and from other animals by determining whether an animal possesses or lacks the ability to recognize itself in its own reflection.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence

> Despite this, the birds are not classified as being able to recognize their reflection, because those that did were trained to do so and the animal has to be able to do this without human assistance.

> Macaws have been demonstrated to fully comprehend the concept of object permanence at a young age.

Ability to understand the permanence of objects.

> A study on the little green bee-eater suggests that these birds may be able to see from the point of view of a predator.[39] The brown-necked raven has been observed hunting lizards in complex cooperation with other ravens, demonstrating an apparent understanding of prey behavior.

So like the eagle, who just knows the predator without thinking.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_intelligence

> Such an ability to see from the point of view of another individual had previously been attributed only to the great apes and sometimes elephants. Such abilities form the basis for empathy.

Ability to see from the point of others.

It seems that intelligence must have occured at the cellular level, or potentially just before. So it seems like origin of life.
http://jonlieffmd.com/blog/intelligent-cancer-cells-communicate-with-exosomes

Intelligence existed at the level of individual cells for billions of years. Then it transformed into a network of groups of cells, forming an organization of cells essentially. This organization of cells then had to compete with other organizations of cells, and better adapt in order to gain more resources. So it is already intelligent at the level of individual cells.

> Dengue virus shows unique intelligence and behavior in entering cells with multiple techniques, evading immune responses and, very surprisingly, actively working to stop the effectiveness of vaccines by constantly altering protein shapes. - See more at: http://jonlieffmd.com/blog/spread-of-the-intelligent-dengue-virus#sthash.axygGBSG.dpuf

> Ebola virus has only 7 genes and proteins, but is able to build a very large complex vessel to travel between cells (see post). It uses many different attachment devices to enter each type of human cells. Ebola is able to fool cells into helping it enter. It is able to evade complex immune mechanisms with equally complex counter measures, while relying on this small number of proteins. Ebola is able to create a decoy to confuse the immune system and it commandeers complex protein rafts that are floating in the cell membrane to help it build the new viruses. - See more at: http://jonlieffmd.com/blog/spread-of-the-intelligent-dengue-virus#sthash.axygGBSG.dpuf

Dolphins can have essentially an inner _experience_, but they don't necessarily _think_. Experience without thinking is what it is like before self consciousness. Maybe awareness of your experience is possible, but not consciousness, the ability to think about the awareness of your experience. So humans can think about the awareness of their experience, but dolphins can only be aware of their experience, without thinking. But they may be thinking still, but are they aware that they are thinking? I think that is it, that they are aware that they are thinking.

So thinking about thinking is where self awareness gets created.

> Anatolian obsidian as a raw material for stone-age tools was distributed as early as 12,000 B.C., with organized trade occurring in the 9th millennium.(Cauvin;Chataigner 1998)[10] In Sardinia, one of the four main sites for sourcing the material deposits of obsidian within the Mediterranean, trade in this was replaced in the 3rd millennium by trade in copper and silver.

Trade occurred before the first civilizations.

> As early as 9000 BC both grain and cattle were used as money or as barter (Davies) (the first grain remains found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC).

First obsidian use around 700kya.

Known obsidian use from 14kya in iraq.

3mya oldest tool use.

> the earliest stone tool makers were skilled flintknappers .... The possible reasons behind this seeming abrupt transition from the absence of stone tools to the presence thereof include ... gaps in the geological record.

Bronze age transition, 8000-6000kya.

> In regions such as Subsaharan Africa, the Stone Age was followed directly by the Iron Age. The Middle East and southeastern Asian regions progressed past Stone Age technology around 6000 BCE. Europe, and the rest of Asia became post–Stone Age societies by about 4000 BCE. The proto-Inca cultures of South America continued at a Stone Age level until around 2000 BCE, when gold, copper and silver made their entrance, the rest following later. Australia remained in the Stone Age until the 17th century.

First money in babylon: 
> The Code of Hammurabi, the best preserved ancient law code, was created ca. 1760 BC (middle chronology) in ancient Babylon. It was enacted by the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi. Earlier collections of laws include the code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (ca. 2050 BC), the Code of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC) and the code of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (ca. 1870 BC).[27] These law codes formalized the role of money in civil society. They set amounts of interest on debt... fines for 'wrongdoing'... and compensation in money for various infractions of formalized law.

> It has long been assumed that metals, where available, were favored for use as proto-money over such commodities as cattle, cowry shells, or salt, because metals are at once durable, portable, and easily divisible.[43] The use of gold as proto-money has been traced back to the fourth millennium BC when the Egyptians used gold bars of a set weight as a medium of exchange,[citation needed] as had been done earlier in Mesopotamia with silver bars.

> The shekel was an ancient unit[52] used in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC to define both a specific weight of barley and equivalent amounts of materials such as silver, bronze and copper. The use of a single unit to define both mass and currency was a similar concept to the British pound, which was originally defined as a one-pound mass of silver.

> The first gold coins of the Grecian age were struck in Lydia at a time approximated to the year 700 BC.

> From approximately 1000 BC money in the shape of small knives and spades made of bronze were in use in China during the Zhou dynasty, with cast bronze replicas of cowrie shells in use before this. The first manufactured coins seems to have taken place separately in India, China, and in cities around the Aegean sea between 700 and 500 BC.

> The use and export of silver coinage, along with soldiers paid in coins, contributed to the Athenian Empire's 5th century BC, dominance of the region. The silver used was mined in southern Attica at Laurium and Thorikos by a huge workforce of slave labour. A major silver vein discovery at Laurium in 483 BC led to the huge expansion of the Athenian military fleet.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece

First slaves in greece result of piracy.

> The earliest documented instances of piracy are the exploits of the Sea Peoples who threatened the Aegean and Mediterranean in the 14th century BC.[8] In classical antiquity, the Illyrians and Tyrrhenians were known as pirates, as well as Greeks and Romans. During their voyages, the Phoenicians seem to have sometimes resorted to piracy, and specialized in kidnapping boys and girls to be sold as slaves.[9]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Mediterranean_piracy

> Piracy offered a free and lucrative career, a chance for those who were interested to try to change their lives and better their livelihood a hundredfold in a very short time.
> For example, the area around Crete, famous for its slave markets, was known as “the Golden Sea” because of how profitable the slave trade was.[6] 
> Being kidnapped by pirates and sold into slavery was so common that it was a favorite theme of ancient Greek dramatists.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Greece#Sources_of_supply

Major problem of civilization is the creation of slaves.

Slavery for debt/poverty, punishment, then war. So they had some desire for war. War was because of the development of city states. More and more land. Which was because the kings had convinced themselves that they were doing what's right. So they killed and enslaved anyone in their way. They did not have the time to think everything out in advance.

How did we go from the first kingdoms to warfare?

> The Ubaidians (though never mentioned by the Sumerians themselves) are assumed by modern-day scholars to have been the first civilizing force in Sumer, draining the marshes for agriculture, developing trade, and establishing industries, including weaving, leatherwork, metalwork, masonry, and pottery.

> Sumerian civilization took form in the Uruk period (4th millennium BC), continuing into the Jemdat Nasr and Early Dynastic periods. During the 3rd millennium BC, a close cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians (who spoke a language no relatives of which are known today; see language isolate) and the Semitic Akkadian speakers, which included widespread bilingualism.[12] The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.[12] This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a Sprachbund.[12] Sumer was conquered by the Semitic-speaking kings of the Akkadian Empire around 2270 BC (short chronology), but Sumerian continued as a sacred language. Native Sumerian rule re-emerged for about a century in the Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian Renaissance) approximately 2100-2000 BC, but the Akkadian language also remained in use.
