Individuals have _talent_. This is their ability to solve a group of problems. Each individual has specific talents. So a team is a group of different talents solving a specific problem. So the question is, how to develop talent? Each individual must practice and _gain experience_ related to a specific group of problems. This is probably the purpose of _case based reasoning_. Each individual can develop a group of cases.

Then other individuals have the talent of simplifying all the knowledge by _interviewing_ the talented individuals. They may not know how to explain what they do, but they know how to do it. Then it is up to another individual to engage them in communication to extract out the principles. It would be easier, though, if the individual occasionally reflected on their experience, to organize it into transferrable knowledge. Sort of like writing a book. The individual engaging in a particular experience, would then take notes of important aspects of it's experience, common patterns, etc. This is the _reflection period_. Like meditation.
