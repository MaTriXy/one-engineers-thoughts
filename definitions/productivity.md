A todo list solves the problem of experiencing a reward after you solve problems. The thing is, you naturally experience a reward after solving problems you are currently interested. So the todo list by definition means you are no longer interested in solving the problems. Which is why you don't need a todo list if you are just interested in problem solving in general, and this is where a lot of creativity comes about. You need a todo list when you want to do something, but to do that something you must first do something else. And if there are a lot of those, you might need to remember. And if there are people who are also contributing, they might want to know what you're working on.

But if it's just you, a todo list is for things you are no longer interested in solving, but need to solve/do anyways.

You feel a reward by completing the checklist. And if you are always just completing checklists, or finishing assignments, then you associate learning or problem solving with doing things you don't like to do but have to do. Which is why checklists are bad. You should be getting naturally rewarded by solving problems through play, because they're the problems your interested in right then.

There is still the problem of keeping track of all the problems. But it doesn't need to be a checklist. It can be a space for people to play to find their next problem type of thing. Or to try to just complete the checklist if that's the kind of play they want to do for the day.

So the goal of all learning and productivity should be to get everything to be like play. So we are intrinisically motivated to solve problems that are relevant to us right at the moment. So we never have to do things we don't want to. This doesn't mean you would never do non-playful things. You would want to do other things for other reasons, like clean your teeth because it makes you feel healthy or things like that. I dunno.

But for knowledge learning, it should be the same as play. People create and solve their own problems. But in a way that other people on the outside can learn from what they have figured out without having to necessarily play, but just by reading. Which is another form of play, a story! Imagining you're in a different world, individual play.

### Paper title ideas

#### A Mathematical Theory of Structure

This paper talks about mathematical structures and their properties. It is a simplification and generalization of category theory and type theory, to create a more easily accessible mental model.

#### A Mathematical Theory of Problem Solving
#### A Structural Theory of Problem Solving

A problem is a difference between two structures, with a desire to solve the problem. The desire part will be discussed in a future paper, but for now assume there is desire.

This paper assumes a basic understanding of mathematical structure.

#### A Mathematical Theory of Intelligence
#### A Problem Solving Theory of Intelligence

Builds on problem solving theory from previous paper, applying it to intelligent/cognitive agents. Shows how the problem solving theory is actually a cognitive information structure too, so it completes the framework.

This paper assumes an understanding of mathematical structure and problem solving theory.

#### M: An Intelligent Modeling Language

Builds on intelligence theory to implement a language that can be used to implement intelligent agents that is enjoyable and interesting for humans to use, to aid in human problem solving.

#### Source: An Intelligent Information Interface

Idea of play, flow, and getting into the zone. A UI to handle everything.

#### Tropon: An Evolvable Public Library

### Structure  

It's more like "A mathematical theory of the properties and dynamics of structure".

On the dynamics of structure. A mathematical theory of the evolution of information. The evolution of intelligent structure. The structure of intelligence.
