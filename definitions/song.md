> One definition of a hook is "a musical or lyrical phrase that stands out and is easily remembered."

Composing lines/strings of notes. Therefore, stringing together an experience.

Isolate parts of a song that can stand on their own. A complete part of a theme.

> The way we phrase a line of music conveys the meaning and mood of a song to the listeners. 
> Phrasing is strongly influenced by where we pause and breathe as we sing the lyrics, which words we think are important and emphasize, and how we relate emotionally to the words.

So first you make the music, then you make the phrases of vocal notes. Lines of vocal notes. Make _lines_ of _notes_. Once you make lines of notes, you can then _fill in the lyrics_. Add lyrics into that shape of an experience you've already constructed.

This is why in nirvana the voice usually starts _after_ a _lead in_ with non-vocal music.

Therefore when listening to music, wipe/paint/layer/make notes of vocal sounds that _work_ _well_ _together_. Therefore, in effect, make music.

Once you overlay good vocal notes, then you want to refine the song into cells.

Write songs that appeal to people who want to be alone and effective. To people who want to change the world.

This is how nirvana and tool sound to me.

Kurt kobain comes up with melody before lyrics. It seems like tool does too. Which is why they sound so much _better_. If lyrics come first, then it's hard to find a melody to fit perfectly. Words fit to melody, not other way around.

He writes lyrics at the last minute. So this would mean then that there is no initial meaning to the lyrics. They just _sound good against the tune_. But they don't mean anything.

Then you can _backwards rationalize_. You can adjust the lyrics to give them some meaning, or you can just go over the words that "spewed" out of you (`spew: do without thinking`), and then run other them again to get a _feel_ for them. Then adjust them to make the _story_ or _flow_ better. A _good flow_ is a _good experience/life_.

1. pick a mood
2. start with music
3. work on chords
4. focus on others music for inspiration, on one specific album

> MJK: "I write lyrics and melodies to music. If I don't have music, I can't."

> Everything revolves around the music when it comes to Tool. Music is about listening, the more you play, the more the magic spreads. For me, life is writing and I can do it anywhere. It doesn't matter where I am. I listen. I write. I live. And if you don't live, you have nothing to write about.

> We really don't like it. It's not arrogance at all. We just consider it slightly unnatural. It's not that we're looking down on our fans and that's why we don't want any contact. It's just if we would mix with our fans, they'd most likely feel that they have to tell us how much they like our music and that can easily get to your head. Look at a couple of bands out there, with a lot of them, I always get the feeling their success has gone to their heads. If you start taking yourself too seriously it's not good for the creative process. I always believed that music should speak for itself, that people shouldn't see us as heroes, that our fans shouldn't concentrate on us, that they shouldn't try to feed our egos. Once your ego gets in the way, it is much more difficult to feel music.

> Sometimes interviewees are almost insulting, especially when it comes down to video or TV interviews. Pretty often they've got such an ego that we sometimes wonder how we fit on the same screen. They're clowns, goofballs and they think they're so funny â€“ full of energy and personality. Do you know what I mean? They're just full of themselves and they don't have a clue and they're not interested in anything else but themselves. They don't even listen. They got a bunch of questions and you don't even get the chance to have something that remotely resembles a conversation. I really can't respect them and if they'd take a minute and realize what they're doing and how ridiculous they are, they wouldn't be able to respect themselves.

> A cell can be developed, independent of its context, as a melodic fragment, it can be used as a developmental motif. It can be the source for the whole structure of the work; in that case it is called a generative cell.
