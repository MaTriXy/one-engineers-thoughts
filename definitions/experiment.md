An experiment is a way to create observations.

You can also get observations just from day-to-day experience. But experiments create observations outside of your experience perhaps.

Experiments isolate variables, so you can reproduce the effect.

The result of many experiments is a set of observations.

Given a set of observations, a theory accurately describes all observations. In addition, the theory will allow predictions of new observations.

Current scientific theories are scattered and complicated, because they have evolved or many centuries and have never been formally refactored.

By gathering all scientific experiments and observations, or at least the ones that aren't lost to history, we can use modern computational problem-solving techniques to automatically figure out theories that describe them perhaps. Then that autogenerated theory can be automatically simplified so into a form that is easy for a minimally educated person to understand.
