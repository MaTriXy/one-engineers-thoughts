A structure is a mathematical object.

A structure is a subset of a pattern.

A structure is a pattern of information.

Information naturally fluctuates at random. This often forms patterns. Some of these patterns form structures. These structures and patterns then can have new relations with each other.

So, a structure is a pattern of information with some level of permanence and recognizability.

A wave pattern can have a structure. A structure is like the still view, the pattern is the moving view.

A structure has some relation to an observation. An observation can't really have a pattern, but many observations can show a pattern. An observation can be of a pattern or a structure.

> Structure is a fundamental, tangible or intangible notion referring to the recognition, observation, nature, and permanence of patterns and relationships of entities

An object is a structure, as in an attribute.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure

Information -> Pattern -> Structure -> Object
No recognizability -> Increasingly easy recognizability. Recognizability is purely based on an agents observations, the speed at which they can interpret information using knowledge. These things exist outside of our mind, but our naming for them is based on recognizability.

> recognition of patterns and regularities


A structure is recognizable information. Therefore, it requires a mind.

Working memory structures have a type. The structures are graphs of graphs, pattern theory. Those get symbolically represented as types.

Paper: Structure Theory

A structure is recognizable information. Another paper will be written on the topic of recognition, which requires cognition. For now, however, we can assume there is an agent that can recognize information. And this, we call _structure_.

Types
  Structures
    Relations
    Constraints
    Patterns
    Graphs
    Trees
    Lists
    Collections
    Functions
    Sets

Types have a set of relations, and a set of constraints on those relations. Types are mental structures.

So a type is an abstract representation of a information structure.

Structures can be named only if there is an agent capable of recognizing and naming them. Structures exist outside of their representation, but they are not the representation. As such, all naming and terminology are symbolic.

The evolution of structure.
Problem Solving Theory

Types are named structures. For the past few hundred years, we have been identifying these structures and discovering how they relate to other structures and how they can change. These are all symbolic. So symbolically, we are representing the non-symbolic as information without any recognition.

Structures and functions. Functions are relations. Are relations functions?

> Toward a Formal Theory of Information Structure

A Mathematical Theory of Information Structure

Naming requires cognition. We store information in some memory. We then create abstract symbols to describe information using text. A formal system of this is using types. Types are an abstract representation of structures. So there's this interplay between the raw information, our brain's ability to process that information, and the way we describe that information. A description is just a structure too. So then the problem is, how do we find out a general mdoel of descriptions that can account for all our observations?

To do that, we need to define a problem.

Structure comes from a word about the process of building or construction.

> The Calculus of Constructions (CoC) is a type theory created by Thierry Coquand. It can serve as both a typed programming language and as constructive foundation for mathematics.

A structure is the most general type in a cognitive information system. As such, it can be used for the base of mathematics, and it is easy to visualize.
