definition agreement
  An agreement is to find/make a set of new views, that every self can have/take.
```

Why do many people need to agree? It takes so much work to agree.

> have the same opinion about something; concur.

To agree is to have same views on topic.

Given a _meet_ of _selfs_, each with their own _views_ (set of views, which are like individual associations or something, a view is a relation/association of information/data), what they _agree_ on are the _views_ that are the _same_.

```
definition view
  An interpretation of a fact.
