> While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the evidence given


> The word "proof" comes from the Latin probare meaning "to test". Related modern words are the English "probe", "probation", and "probability", the Spanish probar (to smell or taste, or (lesser use) touch or test),[5] Italian provare (to try), and the German probieren (to try). The early use of "probity" was in the presentation of legal evidence. A person of authority, such as a nobleman, was said to have probity, whereby the evidence was by his relative authority, which outweighed empirical testimony.[6]

Proofs guarantee correctness, unless proofs are incomplete (not everything is covered), or flawed/incorrect. So for proofs to be useful for validating a program, they need to be complete and correct themselves, which takes time to do. But if there is a community, then slowly over time proofs become complete and correct, and can be used as a jumping off point for anyone else.
