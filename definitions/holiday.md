A day to do good things intentionally for others. Cook big meals. Bring people together. Enjoy each other's company. Take time out of your normal experience, to observe the present. To be in the moment. We needed to formally establish these days so that we don't forget, and become like slaves. And so that we can do the things we actually enjoy every now and then. Only on the "days off" can you do things you actually enjoy.

This comes from the mindset of scarcity, when the majority of time we have to work. But in a workless society, you don't need any holidays, because all days you can do whatever you want. But maybe holidays does end up being a pattern we enjoy anyways. Days where everyone all at once does the same type of activities. This way we can all have similar experiences. We can all unite as a single whole entity, for a brief period of time.
