The first part of designing solution could be doing _anything_, not just building a UI. It could be creating emails, desiging newsletters, setting up phone calls, etc. So need to figure out all the "actions you need to perform" ("things you need to do") initially, and the types of things you do. Then the cost of doing those things. Then once you decide on needing an app, decide on what the app should do. Then once you know what the app should do, you should get people to be engaged in the app. Then once you do that, you get the app very nicely designed so not only is it engaging, but it is high quality. You can do all those things in parallel, but that's the general sequence of solutions.
