- search "beautiful logging"
- search "beautiful logging" within the past year (to see what people have recently done)
  - nope, results were about log cabins and such
- look for specific logging-related repos on github i can recall from memory
- looked for images on google images to see if there's anything that looks pretty (haha, good luck with that machine)

By this point I have some sense of what debugger output should look like; I have found some inspiration.

- Now I start debating in my head, should I build my own or use existing tool?

## problem: what is the best way to colorize/format the logging?

- problem: should colors mean something, or just be there to visually separate things?
- problem: what should the format look like?
  - research: what are the different ways popular platforms format their logs?
    - example: `timestamp source[dyno]: message`
