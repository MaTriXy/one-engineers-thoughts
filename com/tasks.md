- break a task up into smaller ones
  - how do you break it up?
- add your tasks right now
  - since a task is a solution, at meetings you're specifying solutions
    - but the best way to find solutions is while you're problem solving
- getting it done
  - the reason "done" doesn't make sense is because problem/solution space keeps evolving
  - "done" mean's you've implemented a solution
  - Why "done" isn't done.
- "how does this connect to that? i'm not quite seeing it"
  - someone else has imagined an end state, but you don't see how they got there
    - they saw a problem, and came up with a solution, which is that end state
- "this way you could do x"
  - assuming x is an important thing to do (is in the desired space)
- things we're thinking in the middle of it:
  - what does it _do_? imaging in your mind how it might work given your current knowledge and your alignment to make it easier and such
  - how does it work in your mind? visualizing the potential end state
