@garrett: are you just using `vi` and copy/pasting, or what's your workflow for adding that file?

garrett [1:20 PM] 
yep, anything goes on site-stage haha

it gets annoying in some ways

tj [2:43 PM]
it's difficult to interpret "structured" logs

went in the middle for Go, when you do a log.Info() it sends the args and the msg as json

tj [2:44 PM]
so you can do stuff with it later it's not just a string

tj [2:44 PM]
but then the positions of args are important

I think this is very interesting. But from a company perspective, it's too off topic and considered unproductive. So his to demonstrate that he doesn't do that is to show he realizes it's off topic.
