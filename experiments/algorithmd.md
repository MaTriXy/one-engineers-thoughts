Highlight the `while` loop, and show the "problem model" for that loop (those "instructions", or "actions", or really "solutions"). So this way we know what problem it's solving.

Maybe the problem can be demonstrated in an animation too. So sort of like a movement through animations, like you were asking your friend to show you the different pieces you were interested in at that moment. And it knew exactly what would help you learn best. This means, the computer would need to have a good mental model of your experience. To do this, it needs to _communicate with you_. It needs to know how you think. It can't tell without having a direct probe into your brain. The best it can do is ask you questions, and potentially observe your body language through a camera, like a normal human would.

- observe human body language and facial expressions through camera.
- chat with human in slack/irc so it learns your likes and dislikes.
- given the current information on the screen, and the _progression of experience_ the user has gone through in navigating/exploring these animations, and based on how the user is feeling, what information is the best to help them with? This means you don't always need to present the info if they are in the zone. But if you see that they're tired, you can give them tips and stuff, to peak their excitement and help them get motivated to continue their project! Send emails with funny messages, maybe hack together some automatically generated mockups as scribbles, to spark some ideas in the user's head. Or ask the user if we can help with anything, maybe the user would like it if the machines did some research on some topics, found some links, or whipped together some pseudocode, or generated a new project "like I create most of my other projects on github", and it just does those things in the background. Then after it's done, maybe it takes a break. And gets some rest. Maybe it explores some other patterns, to _expand it's knowledge in unexpected ways_. Maybe it sleeps for a little bit, so it can consolidate it's knowledge, and find new connections. Maybe it can spend some time organizing and simplifying the knowledge, so it can provide better help to the user next time. So it would have to prioritize, what is the best use of it's time? How could _hiring more machines_ help? So you find something, and then try to get everyone involved.
