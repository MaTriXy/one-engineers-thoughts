                    origin story
                      note The office was created in 1773, with the title of Governor-General of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over Fort William, but supervised other British East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833, and the official became known as the Governor-General of India.
                      note In 1858, the territories of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British government; see British Raj.

      summary So the point is, this guy went to a university that was founded under the principles of the british empire, which only let select few individuals that they could _grade_ and _fund_ through "generous grants". This means, if you do something that will also benefit them, if you create a scientific tool that benefits them too, then you will be rich and happy, like us. That's what you're told. And so he thinks he's special. He has a billion dollars, he must have done things "right". Nope. Well, it's right from the perspective of making the investors even more wealthy, but not right in the larger perspective.
note I should be able to paste a sentence of wikipedia text in, and it should eventually come up with the same thing I do. So in a sense, it should learn how I transform sentences into models, then do it that way it's self.
